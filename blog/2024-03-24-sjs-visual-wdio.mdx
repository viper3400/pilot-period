> **Don't let visual bugs slip through! Learn how to quickly add WDIO visual regression testing to your Serenity/JS project.**

I recently watched a video tutorial by Wim Selles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQRGpWX3fsk) explaining the new WebdriverIO snapshot and visual snapshot features introduced in version 8.29.0.

Playwright also offers some support for snapshot and visual snapshot testing [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).

I won't go into detail of visual regression testing since there are many resources available online.

While snapshot testing isn't currently part of Serenity/JS, this guide shows how to quickly integrate the feature into your Serenity/JS test specs using custom interactions.

For more on custom interactions, refer to the Serenity/JS documentation [here](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/Interaction/).

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the `serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template` [repository](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

This ensures your project is set up correctly.

3. Install the visual testing support for WebdriverIO:
```bash
npm install @wdio/visual-service --save-dev
```

If you encounter errors, check the system requirements for 
visual testing with WDIO [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing#system-requirements).

4. Enable the visual service in your project's root directory file `wdio.conf.ts`:

```ts title="./wdio.conf.ts"
// Test runner services
// Services take over a specific job you don't want to take care of. They enhance
// your test setup with almost no effort. Unlike plugins, they don't add new
// commands. Instead, they hook themselves up into the test process.
services: [ 'visual' ],
```

5. Update your project's root directory file `tsconfig.json` to include the necessary WDIO types:

```json title="./tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": [
          ...
          "expect-webdriverio",
          "@wdio/visual-service"
        ],
    }
}
```

## Creating Custom Interactions

Now, let's create our custom Serenity/JS interactions:

```typescript title="./test/serenity/CustomInteractions.ts"
import { Interaction, MetaQuestionAdapter } from '@serenity-js/core';
import { PageElement } from '@serenity-js/web';

export const CompareScreen = (snapshotIdentifier: string) =>     
    Interaction.where('#actor compares whole page screenshot', 
        async actor => {
            return expect(browser).toMatchFullPageSnapshot(snapshotIdentifier)
        })

export const CompareElement = (
    pageElement: MetaQuestionAdapter<PageElement<unknown>, PageElement<unknown>>,
    snapshotIdentifier: string) =>     
    Interaction.where('#actor compares element screenshot', 
        async actor => {
            const selector = await pageElement.answeredBy(actor)
            return expect(selector.nativeElement())
                .toMatchElementSnapshot(snapshotIdentifier)
        }
    )
```

:::info
These custom interactions are designed specifically for Serenity/JS and **WDIO**.

If you're using **Playwright**, you'll need to implement interactions according to Playwright's approach to snapshots [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).

A more comprehensive solution that integrates seamlessly with Serenity/JS and supports all browser automation tools would require additional development beyond this basic example.

## Using the Interactions in Specs

Here's how to use the interactions in your spec files:

```ts title="./specs/ui/todo/serenity-js_website.spec.ts"
 it(`offers examples to help you practice test automation`, async () => {
        ...
        // Once we know the system is up and running, Wendy can proceed with the web-based scenario.
        await actorCalled('Wendy').attemptsTo(
            TodoList.createListContaining([
                `Buy dog food`,
                `Feed the dog`,
                `Book a vet's appointment`,
            ]),
            CompareScreen('list_after_creation'),
            TodoList.markAsCompleted([
                `Buy dog food`,
                `Feed the dog`,
            ]),
            CompareScreen('list_after_completion'),
            Ensure.that(
                TodoList.outstandingItemsCount(),
                equals(1)
            ),
        )
    })
```


:::info Important Considerations
* Visual testing is not a silver bullet. Refer to the WebdriverIO page for key considerations for optimal use [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing/considerations).
* Choose meaningful names for your reference snapshots. Ensure unique images for unique tests, especially when reusing Serenity/JS tasks containing the 'CompareScreen' and 'CompareElement' interactions.

## Conclusion
n this guide, we've explored how to integrate visual regression testing into your Serenity/JS project 
using custom interactions. This approach allows you to leverage Serenity/JS's powerful testing
capabilities while ensuring the visual consistency of your web application. Remember,
visual testing is a valuable tool, but it's important to use it strategically and with
clear expectations. By following the best practices, you can effectively incorporate visual
regression testing into your Serenity/JS test suite.
