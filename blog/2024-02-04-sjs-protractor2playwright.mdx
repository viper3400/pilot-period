title: Serenity/JS - Migrate from Protractor to Playwright

>***When I chose Serenity/JS as a vendor-agnostic API, my intention was to isolate my test specification from the test runner.
Today, I seamlessly transitioned from Protractor to Playwright in less than 10 minutes. 
The kicker? No need for me, any AI, or non-AI tool to lay a finger on selectors or test specs. 
All it took was a swift config update.***

In this blog post, we'll explore a seamless transition from Protractor to Playwright
in a Serenity/JS project, all achieved in a mere 10 minutes. Witness how the power 
of Serenity/JS makes this migration effortless, requiring no modifications to your 
selectors or Jasmine test specifications. Let's dive in and unlock a smoother,
more efficient testing experience.

:::tip Any browser, any device, any interface
«[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) is a modular and extensible abstraction 
layer that works seamlessly with integration tools like Playwright, 
Selenium, WebdriverIO, Appium, or Axios, and gives you a consistent, 
intuitive, and vendor-agnostic API to work with.»

## Prepare Example project

_(Examples on this page where tested with Serenity/JS version 3.16.0)_

Let's start by setting up a small example project based on the Protractor with Jasmine 
template provided by Serenity/JS, as this combination was the most common.

Clone the [serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template), 
install the NodeJS dependencies, and start a test run to ensure that the template is working.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-jasmine-protractor-template.git
cd serenity-js-mocha-protractor-template
npm install
npm test
```
## Migration

### Additional Dependencies

Add additional dependencies to your project:

```sh
npm install @serenity-js/playwright
npm install playwright
npm install mocha
npm install @serenity-js/mocha
```

Install Playwright:
```sh
npx playwright install
```

### Mocha Configuration

Add a `.mocharc.yml` file to the root directory of you project:

```yml title=".mocharc.yml"
check-leaks: false
color: true
diff: true
full-trace: true
reporter: '@serenity-js/mocha'
require:
  - 'ts-node/register'
  - 'src/serenity.config.ts'
timeout: 30000
v8-stack-trace-limit: 100
spec:
  - './spec/**/*.spec.ts'
```
### Serenity/JS Actors

Create a `src` folder in your project root and create an `Actors.ts` file:

```ts title="./src/Actors.ts"
import { Actor, Cast, TakeNotes } from '@serenity-js/core';
import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright, PlaywrightOptions } from '@serenity-js/playwright';
import { CallAnApi } from '@serenity-js/rest';
import * as playwright from 'playwright-core';

export class Actors implements Cast {
    constructor(
        private readonly page: playwright.Page,
        private readonly options: PlaywrightOptions,
    ) {
    }

    prepare(actor: Actor): Actor {
        return actor.whoCan(
            BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.usingPage(this.page, this.options),
            TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad(),
            CallAnApi.at(this.options.baseURL)
        );
    }
}
```
:::tip Remark
There are two ways to give an actor the ability 
to [BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright](https://serenity-js.org/api/playwright/class/BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright/):
1. `.using(browser)`

A new browser instance is created for every `it` block in your Mocha `*.spec.ts` file. 
This means you **cannot access** a page you've navigated to in your first `it` block 
in your second `it` block.

2. `.usingPage(page)`

The browser instance, or Playwright page instance, will be re-used for the entire
`*.spec.ts` file. 
This means you **can access** a page you've navigated to in your first `it` block in 
your second `it` block.
:::

### Serenity/JS Configuration

Create a `serenity.config.ts` file in the same `src` folder.

```ts title="./src/serenity.config.ts"
import { configure, Duration, NoOpDiffFormatter } from '@serenity-js/core';
import { BrowserContextOptions } from 'playwright';
import * as playwright from 'playwright-core';

import { Actors } from './Actors';

let browser: playwright.Browser;
let page: playwright.Page;

export const mochaHooks = {
    async beforeAll(): Promise<void> {
        browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
            headless: false
        });

        const contextOptions : BrowserContextOptions = { baseURL: 'https://serenity-js.org' }
        const context = await browser.newContext(contextOptions);
        page = await context.newPage();

        configure({
            actors: new Actors(page, {
                defaultNavigationTimeout:   Duration.ofSeconds(2).inMilliseconds(),
                defaultTimeout:             Duration.ofMilliseconds(750).inMilliseconds(),
            }),
            diffFormatter: new NoOpDiffFormatter(),
            crew: [
                '@serenity-js/console-reporter',
                [ '@serenity-js/serenity-bdd',          { specDirectory: 'spec' }], 
                [ '@serenity-js/web:Photographer',      { strategy: 'TakePhotosOfInteractions'    } ],
                [ '@serenity-js/core:ArtifactArchiver', { outputDirectory: 'target/site/serenity' } ],
            ]
        });
    },

    async afterAll(): Promise<void> {
        if (browser) {
            await browser.close()
        }
    }
}
```

In our example `Actors` class, we initiate a `Browser` object, create a new
`Context` with a new `Page` and give the `Actor` the `Ability` to interact
with this page.

### Angular Sychronisation in Non-Angular Project

In the `serenity-js_website.spec.ts` example file, remove the `UseAngularSynchronisation`, as the page we're
interacting with is not even an Angular page.

Uncomment the following line in `protractor.conf.ts`. so we will be able to use
Protractor and Playwright side by side.

```js title="./protractor.conf.js"
    onPrepare: function() {
         ...
         browser.waitForAngularEnabled(false);
    },
```
### Additional npm Scripts

In the script section of your `package.json` and two new scripts:

```json title="./package.json"
...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test:execute:playwright": "mocha --config .mocharc.yml",
    "test:playwright": "failsafe clean test:execute:playwright test:report",
    ... 
  }
```

## First Testrun Using Playwright

Congratulations! You're done. Just run `npm run test:playwright`.
You can still run the tests with Protractor by running `npm test`. 
If you're satisfied with Playwright, you can remove all dependencies
from Protractor and Jasmine from your project now.

:::tip Mocha vs. Playwright Test
In this scenario, we use Mocha as the test runner for Playwright,
instead of the native Playwright test runner.
Migration to the Playwright test runner may also be straightforward,
but you will have to replace some imports in your files.
For more information, refer to the 
[Serenity/JS handbook](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/playwright-test/#examples-and-project-templates)
