>***Next Chapter: Don't reinvent the wheel! Discover how to seamlessly integrate BDD scenarios into your existing Serenity/JS and Playwright setup, unlocking the power of code reuse across component testing and user acceptance tests. Say goodbye to redundant work and hello to efficient testing.***

In the [last tutorial](/sjs-playwright-ct), I showed how to do component testing using Serenity/JS and Playwright. To be honest, it's a very simple component, making it difficult to create a real-world example. Let's just assume it's a coffee counter for controlling how many cups of coffee you drink.

Component testing ensures that your self-contained components work as expected. For user acceptance, there may be some additional things necessary to verify functionality.

The good news is: You can reuse what you've already prepared for the component tests and dive into the user scenarios.

In this article, I will demonstrate how we can integrate BDD scenarios into the project I prepared the last time. I will use Serenity/JS BDD features. These BDD scenarios will run in the same project like the component tests and will reuse Serenity/JS `PageElements` and `Tasks` that we already used in the component tests.

I cloned the last example and updated all packages to the latest versions to be up to date and created a [new repository](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial). If you want to follow all the steps from scratch I suggest going back and starting with the [component testing tutorial](/sjs-playwright-ct) and coming back once you've finished.

To start, you've to add some additional dev dependencies to your project:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber 
npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/cucumber
```

:::warning Mind the dependency versions!

Serenity/JS is a monorepo and it's strictly recommended that all dependencies to the project have the same version. Here's the trap with my simple `npm install` approach, as this will always install the latest version, which might be incorrect.

:::

This time I will not list the file content in detail but refer to the repository and some explanations.

Key to using BDD and Serenity/JS with cucumber is the [features folder](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/tree/main/features).

```
features
|- coffee-counter
|  |- coffee-counter.feature
|  \- readme.md
|
|- step-definitions
|  |- counter.steps.ts
|  \- parameter.steps.ts
|
|- support
|  |- Actors.ts
|  \- serenity.config.ts
```

To enable Serenity/JS, we need the `support` folder with the `Actors.ts` and the `serenity.config.ts`.

:::tip

To learn more about folder structure, read about [requirements hierarchy](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#serenity-bdd-best-practices) in the original Serenity/JS docs.
To learn more about cucumber features, read [this](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/).

:::

To run cucumber, add a `cucumber.js` [configuration file](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/cucumber.js) to your project root. Among other things, we configure to use Serenity/JS Cucumber adapter in here.

Add two new scripts to the `package.json`

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
    ...
    "test:cucumber:execute": "cucumber-js",
    "test:cucumber": "failsafe clean serenity-bdd:update test:cucumber:execute test:report"
}
```

There is still one configuration thing left: The `create-next-app` from the last tutorial created a `tsconfig.json` for us. Some compile options are not compatible with cucumber.js, and we have to include the `features` folder.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions":
   {
     "module": "commonjs",
     "moduleResolution": "node",
     "esModuleInterop": true,
   },
   {
    "include": [
      "features/**/*.ts",
    ]
   }
}
```

To not interfere with the original Next.js configuration, I create a copy `tsconfig.next.ts`. I configured the Next.js itself to use this configuration in `next.config.mjs` instead of the `tsconfig.ts` file, just to make sure we still use the right config when building the Next.js app.

```js title="next.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    typescript: { tsconfigPath: 'tsconfig.next.json'}
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Until now, we just did some configuration tweaks. Now we're ready to take a look back into our [coffee counter scenario](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/features/coffee-counter/coffee-counter.feature) again. Now have a look into the [counter steps definitions](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/features/step-definitions/counter.steps.ts). Here is where the magic happens. We just reuse the same tasks we [already provided for component testing](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/src/components/CounterSerenity.ts):

```ts title="counter.step.ts"
import { Given, Then, When } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { Actor } from '@serenity-js/core';

import { CounterSerenity } from '../../src/components/CounterSerenity';

Then('{pronoun} should see that the "Increase" button is enabled', async (actor: Actor) =>
    actor.attemptsTo(
        CounterSerenity.EnsureIncreaseButtonIsEnabled()
    ))
```

You're nearly ready to run the test the first time. Make sure that you start your server with `npm run dev` on port 3000.

Then run `npm run test:cucumber` and find the BDD report in the `target/site` folder.
