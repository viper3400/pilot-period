## About Serenity/JS

[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) is a modular and extensible abstraction layer that works seamlessly 
with integration tools like Playwright, Selenium, WebdriverIO, Appium, or Axios, 
and gives you a consistent, intuitive, and vendor-agnostic API to work with.
It integrates with popular test runners like Cucumber, Jasmine, Mocha, and Playwright Test.
