<p><strong>Silence on a blog feed isn’t absence - it’s time spent building elsewhere. May the new year reward curiosity, deep work, and those who create without broadcasting every step.</strong></p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-long-pause-honestly-earned">A Long Pause, Honestly Earned<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/not-ever-season-needs-content#a-long-pause-honestly-earned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur A Long Pause, Honestly Earned" title="Direkter Link zur A Long Pause, Honestly Earned" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>After more than a year and a half without posting, it’s clear that writing a regular tech blog isn’t climbing back onto my priority list anytime soon.
The past months demanded focus elsewhere, and the silence here reflects that more honestly than any editorial plan ever could.
Still, stepping in for a moment feels necessary - not to restart anything, but to disrupt the assumption that absence equals disengagement.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="time spent elsewhere" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/other-focus-5a3107a1883e8ab5684a6c991165c567.jpg" width="1200" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>What this long break sharpened is my respect for those who continue to write consistently in a landscape dominated by AI-generated noise.
Publishing thoughtful, human-made work today is almost rebellious.
It requires intent, patience, and the willingness to contribute without expecting clicks, revenue, or algorithmic favor.
The people who still craft posts out of curiosity, conviction, or the desire to share real experience deserve more than
quiet admiration—they represent a part of tech culture that refuses to disappear under automated convenience.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="seasons-of-building-over-documenting">Seasons of Building Over Documenting<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/not-ever-season-needs-content#seasons-of-building-over-documenting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Seasons of Building Over Documenting" title="Direkter Link zur Seasons of Building Over Documenting" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve been building, learning, breaking things, and moving fast enough that documenting it all stopped feeling essential.
And that’s fine. Not every season supports writing, and not every thought needs to be turned into content.
But there’s value in showing up occasionally, if only to remind myself that reflection doesn’t require a publishing cadence—it requires intention.
A short return like this forces clarity: what do I actually care about sharing, and why?</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-marker-not-a-return">A Marker, Not a Return<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/not-ever-season-needs-content#a-marker-not-a-return" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur A Marker, Not a Return" title="Direkter Link zur A Marker, Not a Return" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>This post won’t be the start of a comeback. It won’t be followed by a weekly stream of insights or tidy summaries of what I’ve been working on.
It’s simply the one piece I’ll leave here for 2025 - a marker, a provocation, and a nod to the people who keep the craft alive while the rest of us drift in and out.</p>
<p>And as the next year unfolds, I hope for more of what tech culture desperately needs: sharper thinking, deeper curiosity, and fewer performative updates.
May 2026  reward those who build with intent, write with integrity, and ignore the pressure to chase trends for the sake of visibility.</p>
<p>This space will likely stay quiet. But quiet isn’t the same as empty. Sometimes it just means the real work is happening elsewhere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Imagine a tightrope walker blaming their safety net for a fall — retrying, hoping the net won't
catch them the second time, or worse, removing it altogether. Sounds absurd, right?
Yet, in software testing, we often treat "flaky tests" with the same flawed logic.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="tightrope walker" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/tightrope-walker-8f2e808982d52da4c8fb47d40cc6d183.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Something I read recently in a chat when one of the so called e2e tests failed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was it just a "normal flaky test"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>"normal" first step</em> is to retry the failed test,
hope that it pass, then go on - and probably cheer automation tools that support retrying
failed tests for x times before declaring them as failed.</p>
<p>The <em>"normal" second step</em> is to disable this tests to get the build green.</p>
<p>When software people refer to tests as their "saftey net", then I start to wonder the situation,
if they were tightrope walkers. Imagine a situation that you made mistakenly a step a side and fall
down into the saftey net - would you act like in the situation I described above?</p>
<p>Retry again - hope that the net won't catch you the 2nd or 3rd time? Remove the net, because it was
obvoiusly the net's fault you made the wrong step.</p>
<p>Okay, don't let us be to metaphorical and I don't want to elaborate about the reasons
behind flaky tests. There was enough stuff written about that
(a lot of good and a lot of bad stuff).</p>
<p>One good collection of reasons that is a bit aged but I can still relate to:
<a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/12/test-flakiness-one-of-main-challenges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/12/test-flakiness-one-of-main-challenges.html</a></p>
<p>So today I just like to remind you about some skills to learn to avoid "normal flaky tests":</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="learn-more-about-your-application-under-test">Learn more about your application under test<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#learn-more-about-your-application-under-test" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your application under test" title="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your application under test" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Understand application behavior and interactions:</strong> Deep dive into how your application behaves, especially in edge cases.</p>
<p><strong>Handle asynchronous operations:</strong> Ensure you understand and properly handle asynchronous operations within the application.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="learn-more-about-your-test-environment">Learn more about your test environment<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#learn-more-about-your-test-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your test environment" title="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your test environment" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p><strong>Maintain environmental consistency:</strong> Ensure that your test environments are consistent and reflect the production environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure network stability and handling:</strong> Understand how to manage and mitigate network instability that could affect your tests.</p>
<p><strong>Implement robust error handling:</strong> Develop robust error handling to manage unexpected issues gracefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="learn-more-about-your-test-automation-framework">Learn more about your test automation framework<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#learn-more-about-your-test-automation-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your test automation framework" title="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your test automation framework" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Understand parallel execution:</strong> Learn how your test framework handles parallel execution and manage shared resources to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Manage timeouts and synchronization:</strong> Configure proper timeouts and synchronization mechanisms to handle asynchronous operations effectively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="learn-more-about-your-tests">Learn more about your tests<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#learn-more-about-your-tests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your tests" title="Direkter Link zur Learn more about your tests" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Isolate tests:</strong> Ensure that tests are isolated and independent, avoiding interdependencies that could cause cascading failures.</p>
<p><strong>Test data management:</strong> Develop strategies for consistent and reliable test data management to avoid flaky results.</p>
<p><strong>Error handling in tests:</strong> Implement robust error handling within your tests to manage unexpected issues gracefully.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="learn-how-to-fix-it">Learn how to fix it<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#learn-how-to-fix-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Learn how to fix it" title="Direkter Link zur Learn how to fix it" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Finally, learn how to identify the root of your issues within the knowledge fields above,
learn how to fix them - and then - just fix them!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/normal-flaky-tests#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Conclusion" title="Direkter Link zur Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Implementing these strategies to avoid "normal flaky tests" requires effort and isn't free of challenges.
However, the investment in learning about your application, test environment, test automation framework,
and tests themselves pays off significantly. By addressing the root causes of flakiness, you can improve
the reliability and robustness of your tests, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of your software.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Are your test scripts drowning in test data chaos? Say goodbye to clutter and hello to clarity with Serenity/JS's Actor Notepads! Learn how to inject user credentials seamlessly for cleaner, more maintainable tests. Ready to dive in?</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="actors-in-serenityjs">Actors in Serenity/JS<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-actors-notepad#actors-in-serenityjs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Actors in Serenity/JS" title="Direkter Link zur Actors in Serenity/JS" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://serenity-js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Serenity/JS</a> is a testing framework that promotes collaboration, clarity, and maintainability in automated testing. At its core, Serenity/JS introduces the concept of actors, which represent the different users or personas interacting with a web application. Actors are equipped with capabilities and context, allowing them to perform actions and interact with the application under test.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity/JS" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/serenity-js-social-card-3930273354f510b08b0b4317c537637b.jpg" width="1200" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="introducing-actor-notepads">Introducing Actor Notepads<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-actors-notepad#introducing-actor-notepads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Introducing Actor Notepads" title="Direkter Link zur Introducing Actor Notepads" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A key feature of Serenity/JS is the concept of actor notepads. Notepads serve as containers for actor-specific data, such as credentials, expected outcomes, and any other contextual information relevant to the test scenario. Instead of cluttering test scripts with data setup details, actor notepads encapsulate this information within the actor itself.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="example">Example<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-actors-notepad#example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Example" title="Direkter Link zur Example" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's assume a small test where an actor:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Navigates to the login page of the application (<a href="https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login</a>).</li>
<li class="">Enters the username retrieved from the actor's notepad into the username input field on the login page.</li>
<li class="">Enters the password retrieved from the actor's notepad into the password input field on the login page.</li>
<li class="">Clicks on the login button to submit the credentials.</li>
<li class="">Waits until a flash message appears on the page, indicating a successful login, with the expected result retrieved from the actor's notepad.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, we prepare two actors called Tom Smith, who is allowed to login and Jan Doe, who is not allowed to login.
We put their login credentials and expected result into their notepads, using the ability to <a href="https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/TakeNotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">TakeNotes</a>.</p>

<p>To start right away with Serenity/JS using Playwright test I recommend to use a <a href="https://serenity-js.org/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#playwright" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Serenity/JS template</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="advantages-of-using-actor-notepads">Advantages of Using Actor Notepads<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-actors-notepad#advantages-of-using-actor-notepads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Advantages of Using Actor Notepads" title="Direkter Link zur Advantages of Using Actor Notepads" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> By delegating data setup to actor notepads, test scripts focus solely on orchestrating actor actions, leading to cleaner and more readable code.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Actor notepads encapsulate actor-specific data, promoting better organization and reducing the likelihood of data misuse or modification.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Reusability:</strong> Actor notepads facilitate the reuse of actors across multiple tests without duplicating data setup logic, improving test maintainability and reducing code duplication.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> As test suites grow, managing data setup through actor notepads proves more scalable and manageable than injecting data through parameters.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Enhanced Reporting:</strong> Serenity/JS emphasizes descriptive and readable test reports. Actor notepads enable better reporting by associating test steps with relevant actor context, enhancing test comprehensibility.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Flexibility for Extension:</strong> Actor notepads provide a flexible mechanism to extend actor capabilities or introduce additional data for testing purposes, without significantly modifying test script structure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-actors-notepad#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Conclusion" title="Direkter Link zur Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, leveraging actor notepads within Serenity/JS tranforms automated testing,
offering a streamlined approach to managing test data. By encapsulating test data within actors,
test scripts become clearer, more maintainable, and less prone to errors.
With the separation of concerns afforded by actor notepads, the focus shifts from data setup
to orchestrating meaningful test actions, resulting in enhanced readability and scalability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I recently watched a video tutorial by Wim Selles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQRGpWX3fsk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a> explaining the new WebdriverIO snapshot and visual snapshot features introduced in version 8.29.0.</p>
<p>Playwright also offers some support for snapshot and visual snapshot testing <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">here</a>.</p>
<p>I won't go into detail of visual regression testing since there are many resources available online.</p>

<p>In the <a class="" href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-playwright-ct">last tutorial</a>, I showed how to do component testing using Serenity/JS and Playwright. To be honest, it's a very simple component, making it difficult to create a real-world example. Let's just assume it's a coffee counter for controlling how many cups of coffee you drink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Serenity/JS" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/serenity-js-social-card-3930273354f510b08b0b4317c537637b.jpg" width="1200" height="675" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Component testing ensures that your self-contained components work as expected. For user acceptance, there may be some additional things necessary to verify functionality.</p>
<p>The good news is: You can reuse what you've already prepared for the component tests and dive into the user scenarios.</p>
<p>In this article, I will demonstrate how we can integrate BDD scenarios into the project I prepared the last time. I will use Serenity/JS BDD features. These BDD scenarios will run in the same project like the component tests and will reuse Serenity/JS <code>PageElements</code> and <code>Tasks</code> that we already used in the component tests.</p>
<p>I cloned the last example and updated all packages to the latest versions to be up to date and created a <a href="https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">new repository</a>. If you want to follow all the steps from scratch I suggest going back and starting with the <a class="" href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/sjs-playwright-ct">component testing tutorial</a> and coming back once you've finished.</p>
<p>To start, you've to add some additional dev dependencies to your project:</p>
<div class="language-sh codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npm install --save-dev @serenity-js/cucumber</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time I will not list the file content in detail but refer to the repository and some explanations.</p>
<p>Key to using BDD and Serenity/JS with cucumber is the <a href="https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/tree/main/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">features folder</a>.</p>

<p>To enable Serenity/JS, we need the <code>support</code> folder with the <code>Actors.ts</code> and the <code>serenity.config.ts</code>.</p>

<p>Add two new scripts to the <code>package.json</code></p>

<p>To not interfere with the original Next.js configuration, I create a copy <code>tsconfig.next.ts</code>. I configured the Next.js itself to use this configuration in <code>next.config.mjs</code> instead of the <code>tsconfig.ts</code> file, just to make sure we still use the right config when building the Next.js app.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know that many software defects arise from unclear requirements?</strong>
<strong>What we're seeing today is AI attempting to assist in test creation,</strong>
<strong>promising to increase code coverage. However, this approach often</strong>
<strong>emphasizes testing our implementations rather than testing against</strong>
<strong>our requirements, which I believe has its value but also carries</strong>
<strong>certain risks that must be carefully considered.</strong></p>

<p>Gemini generated tests that pass. The test reads like an addition is tested, but effectively, it's the division.</p>
<p>To be fair, sometimes the bots detect inconsistencies between the function name and implementation.</p>
<p>However, we miss the point here:</p>
<p><strong>What's unknown is if our customer was requiring an addition or a division.</strong></p>
<p>Either the function implementation is incorrect and should be <code>a + b</code>,
or there's a naming issue, and it should be named <code>divideTwoNumbers()</code>.</p>
<p>So, what are the takeaways?</p>
<p><strong>1. Testing should align with requirements and expected behavior</strong></p>
<p>This is crucial to ensure that code functions as intended and potential issues are identified.</p>
<p><strong>2. Importance of human judgment</strong></p>
<p>It's essential for humans to analyze the information provided by large language models and make informed decisions based on context and domain knowledge.</p>

<p>While I don't want to leave you without a solution to this problem,
it's worth noting that you should utilize AI to assist in testing.</p>
<p>However, it's important to focus on explaining the purpose of the test
and the problem you want to solve, rather than just testing the
mplementation itself.</p>
<p>While this principle is not new, it's crucial to remember,
as it's something that can be overlooked when rushing into the use of AI.</p>

<p>While AI-generated tests can be a great tool for initial test coverage or catching basic errors, relying solely on them can lead us down the wrong path if we're not careful.  The true power lies in combining AI's capabilities with human expertise.  By guiding AI with clear requirements and leveraging its strengths in areas like data analysis and automation, we can create a more efficient and effective testing process.</p>

<p>Playwright introduces an
<a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">experimental component testing approach</a>.
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to seamlessly integrate component testing into a
React/Next.js application using Playwright in conjunction with
<a href="https://serenity-js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Serenity/JS</a>, a powerful testing framework.</p>

<p>Before diving into testing, let's establish a baseline React application.
Following the <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">recommended guidelines</a>,
we'll leverage <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Next.js</a> as our framework of choice.</p>
<p>We'll initialize a Next.js application in
<a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app#non-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">non-interactive mode</a>,
incorporating TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.</p>

For example, pinning the Node.js version to the latest available, currently 20.11.1,
can be achieved with:</p><div class="language-sh codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">volta pin node@latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">git add .</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">git commit -m "Pinned Node.js version using Volta"</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

The component should feature two buttons: "Increase" and "Decrease."</p><p>When I click the "Increase" button, the displayed count value should increment, providing immediate visual feedback. Conversely, clicking the "Decrease" button should decrement the count value. However, these actions should be constrained within a defined range, preventing the count from exceeding a maximum of 10 and a minimum value of 0.</p><p>To ensure intuitive interaction, the buttons should visually indicate when they are disabled, preventing further increment or decrement operations beyond the defined range. This clear visual feedback helps me understand the available actions at a glance, enhancing my overall user experience with the counter component.</p></div></div>
<p>Create a <code>./src/components/Counter.tsx</code> file within your project to implement this

<p><em><strong>Ever feel like your software teams are speaking different languages when it comes to define concrete examples? But here's the spoiler: there's no magical tool to solve it — just the power of collaboration. Get ready for a paradigm shift towards cohesive teamwork!</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effective collaboration among Developers, Testers, and Product Owners (POs) in software development is crucial for success. However, one common hurdle in this collaboration is the struggle to find concrete examples to guide development and testing.
Overcoming this challenge requires <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>training</strong>, and a <strong>team-driven approach</strong>
, without imposing strict directives.</p>

<em>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/martynaszulist-1055898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">martynaszulist</a></em></p>
<p><strong>The Reasons Behind the Struggle</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost it's important to understand the reasons behind this struggle. Here are some of them:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Unclear Requirements</strong>: Incomplete or vague requirements lead to confusion and differing interpretations, making it hard to articulate clear examples.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Communication Barriers</strong>: Technical differences, language nuances, or cultural diversity can hinder clear communication, causing misunderstandings in example definition.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Differing Perspectives</strong>: Each stakeholder brings unique viewpoints, sometimes leading to discordance and difficulty in agreeing on examples.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Assumptions and Implicit Knowledge</strong>: Unspoken assumptions can obscure clarity and perpetuate misunderstandings.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Complexity of Features</strong>: Some features are inherently complex, making it challenging to cover all scenarios with concise examples.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Time Constraints</strong>: Pressures to deliver quickly can limit thorough discussion and exploration of examples.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Inadequate Documentation</strong>: Poorly documented or outdated examples add to confusion and inconsistency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps to Overcome the Struggle</strong></p>
<ol>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Clarify Requirements Collaboratively</strong>: Hold regular refinement sessions where team members openly discuss and clarify requirements, fostering an environment where everyone's input is valued.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Use Techniques for Requirement Elicitation</strong>: Employ methods like user story mapping and behavior-driven development to uncover hidden requirements and ensure alignment with user needs.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Document and Maintain Examples</strong>: Establish a shared repository for documenting examples, ensuring accessibility and encouraging everyone to contribute and maintain it for consistency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By taking these steps, teams can enhance collaboration, improve communication, and overcome the challenge of finding examples effectively in software development.</p>
<p><strong>The Fear of Incomplete Examples</strong></p>
<p>While collaboration is key, it's important to acknowledge the hesitancy some stakeholders
may have in providing examples. They sometimes fear that the examples they give might not fully
capture the complexities of the final solution.</p>
<p>They understand that an example is just that — an example — and worry that it may not
encompass every aspect of the desired outcome.
However, it's essential to emphasize to stakeholders that starting with simple,
straightforward examples is a crucial first step.</p>
<p>These initial examples lay the foundation upon which more complex scenarios can be built
in subsequent iterations. By understanding that examples are iterative and can evolve over
time, stakeholdes can feel more confident in contributing to the collaborative process.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The ability to define concrete examples is a cornerstone of effective collaboration.
By acknowledging the hurdles and embracing the power of teamwork, teams can transcend
language barriers and navigate through the complexities of requirements with confidence.
Through iterative refinement, stakeholders can contribute valuable insights,
ensuring that examples evolve to accurately reflect the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>So, while there may not be a magical tool to solve the challenge of defining examples,
the collective efforts of dedicated teams pave the way for innovation, efficiency,
and ultimately, the delivery of exceptional software solutions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>When I chose Serenity/JS as a vendor-agnostic API, my intention was to isolate my test specification from the test runner.
Today, I seamlessly transitioned from Protractor to Playwright in less than 10 minutes.
The kicker? No need for me, any AI, or non-AI tool to lay a finger on selectors or test specs.
All it took was a swift config update.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're dealing with web automation and HTML tables,
<a href="https://serenity-js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Serenity/JS</a> provides a powerful and expressive way to interact with page elements.</p>
<p>Traditional HTML selectors, such as those
based on CSS or XPath, are often hierarchical.
However, tables are conceptually two-dimensional,
with rows and columns, making it less straightforward
to express certain queries using these selectors.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll explore the usage of the
<a href="https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Page Element Query Language (PEQL)</a>
in Serenity/JS for automating HTML tables, focusing on</p>
<ul>
<li class="">scenarios where you know the index of the row you want to access and</li>

<p>In this example, we introduce new <code>PageElements</code> such as <code>CompanyColumn</code>, <code>ContactColumn</code>, and <code>CountryColumn</code> to represent individual columns. The <code>ContactColumByCountryAndCompany</code> function is used to locate the contact column by matching the country and company. We utilize the <code>where</code> method to filter rows based on the content of the country and company columns and then take the first result.</p>
<p>The report remains readable domain specific language:</p>

<p><em><strong>Unlock the true potential of your ongoing software projects by embracing the richness of customer diversity. Discover how acknowledging varied goals and distinguishing between aspirations and requirements can reshape your development journey. It's time to move beyond the one-size-fits-all approach and foster a collaborative environment that transforms customer input into a tailored roadmap for success.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the dynamic realm of software development, the maxim "customer knows best" has long been a guiding principle in requirements engineering.
However, as we navigate ongoing projects with a sense that they could benefit from a reevaluation, it becomes evident that assuming a singular,
all-knowing customer is a myth that can complicate rather than facilitate effective software development.</p>
<p>This article seeks to delve into the challenges arising from the assumption of homogeneous customer knowledge and proposes actionable strategies to address these complexities within the context of projects that may require a recalibration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="a burning dart" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/dart-1943313_1280-9bac5c1cc9c41aac89880aa9e691fa92.jpg" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/de/users/mastertux-470906/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MasterTux</a></em></p>
<p><strong>The Myth of Homogeneous Customer Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>The potential pitfall of adhering too strictly to the "customer knows best" mantra lies in the assumption of a uniform customer knowledge base. In reality, customers often constitute a diverse group with varying goals, perspectives, and priorities. This diversity poses a significant challenge in transforming their input into concrete requirements.</p>
<p><em>Action Point 1: Acknowledging Diversity</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Recognize and appreciate the diversity within the customer group.</li>
<li class="">Understand that each stakeholder brings a unique set of goals, expectations, and constraints to the table.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Action Point 2: Stakeholder Mapping</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Develop a comprehensive stakeholder map, identifying different departments, roles, and levels within the organization.</li>
<li class="">Use this map to visualize and understand the diverse perspectives that need to be reconciled during the requirements engineering process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals vs. Requirements</strong></p>
<p>While the adage "customer knows best" emphasizes the importance of customer input in requirements engineering, it's crucial to discern between high-level goals and concrete requirements. Customers often express overarching aspirations like "increase efficiency" or "improve user satisfaction." However, these aspirations lack the specificity required for effective software development.</p>
<p>A common challenge arises when customers, in an attempt to articulate their goals, inadvertently propose requirements that may not effectively fulfill those aspirations. This gap underscores the need for guidance in translating broad goals into tangible, actionable requirements.</p>
<p><em>Action Point 3: Goal-to-Requirement Translation</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Establish a structured process for translating overarching goals into specific and measurable requirements.</li>
<li class="">Engage in collaborative workshops with stakeholders to distill broad goals into requirements that directly contribute to achieving those goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Action Point 4: Customer Guidance on Requirement Formulation</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Facilitate open communication with customers to ensure a clear understanding of their goals and expectations.</li>
<li class="">Provide guidance to customers in formulating requirements that align with and effectively contribute to achieving their stated goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>By differentiating between goals and requirements and offering guidance in the translation process, the development team can ensure that the final set of requirements not only captures customer aspirations accurately but also lays the groundwork for a successful and goal-oriented software development process.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Goals and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>The existence of conflicting goals and priorities within the customer group further complicates the process. Different departments may have divergent objectives, and individual stakeholders may prioritize features differently based on their roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p><em>Action Point 5: Open Communication and Negotiation</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Foster an environment of open communication between development teams and customers.</li>
<li class="">Initiate regular check-ins and feedback sessions to identify and address conflicting goals and priorities.</li>
<li class="">Establish a framework for negotiation and compromise that aligns with the overarching project objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Importance of Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>To overcome the challenges posed by the diversity of customer perspectives, effective collaboration between development teams and customers is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Action Point 6: Collaborative Techniques</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="">Utilize collaborative techniques such as workshops, interviews, and prototyping to facilitate a shared understanding of requirements.</li>
<li class="">Ensure that all stakeholders have a platform to voice their concerns and actively participate in the requirements engineering process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while the customer's input remains invaluable in the requirements engineering process, it is crucial to move beyond the simplistic notion that "customer knows best." By acknowledging diversity, translating goals into requirements, addressing conflicting priorities, and fostering collaboration, development teams can navigate the complexities inherent in customer knowledge within the ongoing context of their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Lack of Unified Test Concept</strong></p>
<p>In complex setups, there is often an overarching sense of "quality," but primarily from a strategic perspective. The challenge arises from a lack of a unified test concept, as each team operates with its own testers under the charge of team leads, without a detailed test strategy covering the entirety of the software.</p>
<p><strong>Missing "One Team" Sense in Testing</strong></p>
<p>The decentralized nature of testing across various teams and customizers contributes to a challenge in fostering a "one team" sense in testing. Each team may have its own quality assurance focus, leading to potential blind spots and overlooking critical interactions between components.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinating Test Efforts</strong></p>
<p>The coordination of testing efforts becomes a challenge when decentralized teams operate with varied testing approaches. This dynamic makes it more difficult to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive testing strategy that spans the entire software architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Cross-Team Communication</strong></p>
<p>The absence of a unified test concept often translates into challenges related to cross-team communication. This siloed approach hampers the identification and resolution of cross-functional issues that can significantly impact the end-user experience.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-testers-voice-fostering-consolidated-testing-insights">The Tester's Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/excel-in-complex-setups#the-testers-voice-fostering-consolidated-testing-insights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur The Tester's Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights" title="Direkter Link zur The Tester's Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>To address the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups, it is crucial to elevate the voice of testers from all teams. Their insights and perspectives should be not only valued but celebrated, as they contribute to the creation of a powerful and consolidated image of the software's testing needs.</p>
<p><strong>A Collaborative Approach</strong></p>
<p>Rather than relying on top-down decisions, embrace a collaborative approach where the voices of individual testers are heard, fostering a stronger sense of identification with the testing process. This not only enhances the quality of testing strategies but also empowers teams to take charge of their testing journey.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Listening</strong></p>
<p>Listening to testers from diverse teams is not just about hearing their opinions; it's about acknowledging their unique insights and experiences. This approach empowers testers to shape the testing process, enriching it by uncovering potential blind spots and ensuring that the entire software architecture is thoroughly examined.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="empowering-teams">Empowering Teams<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/excel-in-complex-setups#empowering-teams" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Empowering Teams" title="Direkter Link zur Empowering Teams" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Empower teams with the autonomy to <em>shape</em> their testing strategies. This not only builds a more resilient and effective testing framework but also instills a sense of ownership. When team members actively contribute to the planning and execution of testing efforts, their identification with the process becomes a powerful force.</p>
<p><strong>A Holistic Approach Across Complex Setups</strong></p>
<p>In complex setups involving multiple development teams, customizers, and a diverse customer base, the "build quality in" approach should transcend individual responsibilities. Quality assurance should not be the sole responsibility of specific teams; instead, it should be an overarching principle embraced by every stakeholder in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Building Quality In: A Collective Empowerment</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing that quality cannot be tested into a product only after development but must be an intrinsic part of the entire chain is pivotal. Each development team, customizer, and customer plays a crucial role in this collective empowerment to build quality into the software from the ground up.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion-quality-assurance-starts-with-unified-planning-and-empowerment">Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment<a href="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/excel-in-complex-setups#conclusion-quality-assurance-starts-with-unified-planning-and-empowerment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direkter Link zur Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment" title="Direkter Link zur Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>While the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups may be intricate, it is imperative to recognize that the aftermath of quality issues demands more than a rushed search for test resources. The true solution lies in fostering a culture of qualitative planning, a collective commitment to building quality in, and an empowering environment where every tester's voice is not only heard but celebrated. This proactive approach not only mitigates risks but also lays the foundation for delivering software that stands the test of time.</p>

<p><em><strong>If your approach to software testing consists of merely navigating through predefined test cases with specified inputs and expected outcomes, and your only action is to tick checkboxes without engaging in thorough testing, then you are not functioning as a tester; rather, you are akin to a bot.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the world of software testing, there's a big difference between doing the bare minimum and truly understanding what you're testing. Imagine this: instead of really digging into the software, a tester just goes through a set list of tests, checking boxes as they go. It might look like progress, but it's like scratching the surface without getting to the real stuff.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="human finger touches robot finger" src="https://www.pilot-period.org/de/assets/images/tester-vs-bot-a3173bbe3df321690089ed322964abbf.jpg" width="1280" height="853" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">geralt</a></em></p>
<p><strong>The Ritual</strong></p>
<p>Picture this as a ritual: a tester follows a set path, just ticking off boxes with specific inputs and expected results. It's like a dance, but instead of exploring the software's ins and outs, it's more like going through the motions.</p>
<p><strong>The Misleading Idea</strong></p>
<p>Let's clear something up: just ticking boxes doesn't equal effective testing. It might seem like things are getting done, but it doesn't go deep enough to find the hidden problems in the code.</p>
<p><strong>Going Beyond</strong></p>
<p>Software testing is an art. It's not just about following a script; it's about actively thinking and engaging with the software. Real testers don't stick to the script – they go off the beaten path, checking every corner for potential issues.</p>
<p><strong>More Than Just Checking Boxes</strong></p>
<p>Good testers don't rely only on checkboxes in a test execution plan. They bring in critical thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of how the software works. Thorough testing means crafting tests that go beyond the obvious, thinking ahead, and making sure every part of the software gets a good look.</p>
<p><strong>The Danger of Robotic Testing</strong></p>
<p>When testing becomes mindless checkbox ticking, it's like being stuck in robot mode. The line between a real tester and an automated bot starts to blur. The human touch – the ability to adapt, think creatively, and find tricky issues – disappears.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Embracing  The Quality Journey</strong></p>
<p>In software testing, it's not just about getting through a checklist. It's a journey, a quest to really understand what makes the software tick. Let's move past the routine and embrace the heart of testing – an ever-evolving process that separates the real testers from the software bots.</p>

<p>Nun, diese Frage kannst du eigentlich gleich googeln und du wirst viele richtige Antworten finden.</p>
<p>Also ist dies die Geschichte, wie <strong>ich</strong> Software Tester wurde.</p>
<p>Nachdem ich meine Fachhochschulausbildung vor 15+ Jahren erfolgreich beendet hatte, wurde ich von eine kleinen Software-Entwicklungsfirma angestellt. Sie war spezialisiert auf Software für einen kleinen Markt im Rundfunkbereich. Die Software war sehr modular, hoch konfigurierbar and reich an Schnittstellen - entweder zu unseren eigenen Modulen oder zu Drittherstellern.</p>
<p>Mein Job war es, bei unsren Kunden vor Ort im Rahmen von Einführungsprojekten, die Software zu installieren, zu konfigurieren und in Betrieb zu nehmen. Weiterhin stellte ich vom Büro aus den Remote-Support sicher. Traten im Betrieb Fehler auf, war ich die erste Anlaufstelle für den Kunden.</p>
<p>Zu dieser Zeit gab es in meinem Team weder einen Tester oder einen Testprozess. Es gab auch keinen klar definierten Releaseprozess. Die Entwickler testeten selber, sendeten Debug-Versionen (all in one *.exe Dateien) per E-Mail zum Kunden. Der Kunde probierte es dann aus und nahm die Version in Betrieb.</p>
<p>Dies war mein erster Kontakt mit einem Mantra, welches mich bis heute begleitet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Der Kunde testet selbst! Er weiss ja am Besten, wie es funktionieren muss!"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wenn ich wieder im Support Büro vor unserem Webportal sass, bekam ich dann aber irgendwie einen anderen Eindruck. Wenn der Kunde doch wusste, wie es funktionieren muss, warum nahm er dann immer wieder Versionen in Betrieb, die nach mehr oder eher weniger langer Betriebszeit Fehler verursachten?</p>
<p>Und warum waren die Kunden dann trotzdem so sauer und beschwerten sich über die Qualität? Sie hatten diese doch selber geprüft. Mit ihren eigenen Geschäftsprozessen. Und für gut empfunden? Sonst hätten sie Version doch nicht in Betrieb genommen, oder?</p>
<p>Okay, für den Unterschied zwischen "testen" und "probieren" benötigt es dann wohl mal einen eigenen Post...</p>
<p>Ich war es in jedem Fall leid, bei den Kunden ständig Besserung zu geloben. Schlussendlich, waren es sicher auch unsere Kunden leid, mir das jedes Mal wieder aufs Neue zu glauben.</p>
<p>Nun hatte auch dieses kleine Software-Entwicklungs-Team schon einmal etwas vom Konzept des unabhängigen Testens gehört. Also Software vor der Auslieferung an den Kunden von einer zweiten Instanz (neben dem Entwickler selbst) testen zu lassen.</p>
<p>Ich fand das Thema sofort spannend. Würde es mir doch ermöglichen, mich noch intensiver mit der Funktionsweise der Software auseinanderzusetzen. Auch wäre ich dann im Support bei der Beantwortung der Fragen kompetenter. Wir würden Fehler früher finden. Wir würden lernen, die Geschäftsprozesse des Kunden besser zu verstehen. Alles in allem, auch eine bessere Qualität liefern.</p>
<p>So begann also meine Karriere als Software Tester. Eine spannende Aufgabe mit viel Aufbauarbeit und einer steilen Lernkurve.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Das Testen in einem Team mit 5  - 6 Entwicklern is kein Teilzeitjob. Und ich hatte ja noch die anderen Aufgaben. Als dann die Auftragslage im Projektbereich wieder anzog, wurde mir klar, dass der Fokus nun wieder dorthin verlagert werden würde.  Ich würde so noch weniger Zeit für das haben, was mir lieb geworden war. Somit entschloss ich mich, mich auch einen neuen Weg zu begeben und mich von nun an als Software Tester zu verdingen.</p>]]></content:encoded>
