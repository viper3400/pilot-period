Empower your web automation journey with Serenity/JS \u2013 where simplicity meets precision!***\\n## Automating HTML Tables with Serenity/JS\\n\\nIf you\'re dealing with web automation and HTML tables, \\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) provides a powerful and expressive way to interact with page elements. \\n\\nTraditional HTML selectors, such as those\\nbased on CSS or XPath, are often hierarchical. \\nHowever, tables are conceptually two-dimensional, \\nwith rows and columns, making it less straightforward \\nto express certain queries using these selectors.\\n\\n![Serentiy/JS](/img/SerenityJS.png)\\n\\nIn this article, we\'ll explore the usage of the \\n[Page Element Query Language (PEQL)](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/)\\nin Serenity/JS for automating HTML tables, focusing on \\n- scenarios where you know the index of the row you want to access and \\n- situations where you need to locate a row based on its content.\\n\\n:::tip\\nExamples on this page where tested with Serenity/JS version 3.15.0.\\nTo get started with Serenity/JS and Playwright have a look into the\\n[Serenity/JS Playwright project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template).\\n\\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) is a modular and extensible abstraction layer that works seamlessly \\nwith integration tools like Playwright, Selenium, WebdriverIO, Appium, or Axios, \\nand gives you a consistent, intuitive, and vendor-agnostic API to work with.\\nIt integrates with popular test runners like Cucumber, Jasmine, Mocha, and Playwright Test.\\n\\nHave a look into the other [Serenity/JS project templates](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) as well.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Knowing the Index of the Row\\n\\n![Example Table](/img/Example-Table.png)\\n\\nConsider a scenario where you have a simple table, like [this one from w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp), and you know the index of the row you want to access.\\n\\n```html\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n    <th>Company</th>\\n    <th>Contact</th>\\n    <th>Country</th>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>\\n    <td>Maria Anders</td>\\n    <td>Germany</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>\\n    <td>Francisco Chang</td>\\n    <td>Mexico</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Ernst Handel</td>\\n    <td>Roland Mendel</td>\\n    <td>Austria</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Island Trading</td>\\n    <td>Helen Bennett</td>\\n    <td>UK</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Laughing Bacchus Winecellars</td>\\n    <td>Yoshi Tannamuri</td>\\n    <td>Canada</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti</td>\\n    <td>Giovanni Rovelli</td>\\n    <td>Italy</td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n```\\n\\n The following example demonstrates how to use Serenity/JS to interact with the table:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Ensure, equals } from \'@serenity-js/assertions\';\\nimport { describe, it } from \'@serenity-js/playwright-test\';\\nimport { By, Navigate, PageElements, Text } from \'@serenity-js/web\';\\n\\nconst CustomersTable = () => PageElement.located(By.css(\'#customers\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'customer table\')\\n\\nconst TableRows = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'tr\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table rows\').of(CustomersTable());\\n\\nconst TableColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table columns\')\\n    .of(CustomersTable())\\n\\nconst TableColumnsInRow = (index: number) => \\n    TableColumns().of(TableRows().nth(index));\\n\\nconst CompanyInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(0)\\n    .describedAs(`company column in row ${index}`);\\n\\nconst ContactInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(1)\\n    .describedAs(`contact column in row ${index}`);\\n\\nconst CountryInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(2)\\n    .describedAs(`country column in row ${index}`);\\n\\ndescribe(\'table selector\', () => (\\n    it(\'ensures text of columns in a row\', async ({actor}) => (\\n        actor.attemptsTo(\\n            Navigate.to(\'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(CompanyInRow(1)), equals(\'Alfreds Futterkiste\')),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(ContactInRow(1)), equals(\'Maria Anders\')),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(CountryInRow(1)), equals(\'Germany\'))\\n        ))\\n    )\\n));\\n```\\nThe output in the Serenity/JS report will look like follows:\\n\\n```\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of company column in row 1 does equal \'Alfreds Futterkiste\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of contact column in row 1 does equal \'Maria Anders\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of country column in row 1 does equal \'Germany\'\\n```\\n## Unknown Row Index: Locating Rows by Content\\n\\nIn some scenarios, the table\'s sort order might not be defined, and the index of the row under test may vary. In such cases, you can locate a row based on expected content. Let\'s say we want to ensure that the contact name for \\"Centro comercial Moctezuma\\" in Mexico equals \\"Francisco Chang.\\" Here\'s how you can achieve this with Serenity/JS:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { contain, Ensure, equals } from \'@serenity-js/assertions\';\\nimport { describe, it } from \'@serenity-js/playwright-test\';\\nimport { By, Navigate, PageElement, PageElements, Text } from \'@serenity-js/web\';\\n\\nconst CustomersTable = () => PageElement.located(By.css(\'#customers\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'customer table\')\\n\\nconst TableRows = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'tr\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table rows\').of(CustomersTable());\\n\\nconst CompanyColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(1)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'company columns\');\\n\\nconst ContactColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(2)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'contact columns\');\\n\\nconst CountryColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(3)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'country columns\');\\n\\nconst ContactColumByCountryAndCompany = (country: string, company: string) => \\n    ContactColumns().of(\\n        TableRows()\\n            .where(Text.ofAll(CountryColumns()), contain(country))\\n            .where(Text.ofAll(CompanyColumns()), contain(company))\\n            .first())\\n        .first();\\n\\ndescribe(\'table selector\', () => (\\n    it(\'ensures text of columns in a row\', async ({actor}) => (\\n        actor.attemptsTo(\\n            Navigate.to(\'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(ContactColumByCountryAndCompany(\\n                \'Mexico\',\'Centro comercial Moctezuma\')),\\n            equals(\'Francisco Chang\'))\\n        ))\\n    )\\n));\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we introduce new `PageElements` such as `CompanyColumn`, `ContactColumn`, and `CountryColumn` to represent individual columns. The `ContactColumByCountryAndCompany` function is used to locate the contact column by matching the country and company. We utilize the `where` method to filter rows based on the content of the country and company columns and then take the first result.\\n\\nThe report remains readable domain specific language:\\n\\n```\\n\u2713 Alice navigates to \'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of the first of contact columns \\n    of the first of all table rows of customer table where the \\n    text of country columns does contain \'Mexico\' and the text \\n    of company columns does contain \'Centro comercial Moctezuma\' \\n    does equal \'Francisco Chang\'\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that in this use case, we assume there is only one result for the given combination of country and company. Therefore, we always take the first result to ensure consistency.\\n\\nBy using Serenity/JS and the [Page Element Query Language (PEQL)](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/), you can create expressive and maintainable test scripts for HTML table automation. These examples showcase how to handle scenarios where you know the row index and when you need to locate rows based on their content, providing a flexible and powerful solution for web automation."},{"id":"skills_before_role","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/skills_before_role","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-21-skills_before_role.mdx","title":"The Role of Testers in Cross-Functional Teams","description":"Are cross-functional teams missing out on excellence by expecting everyone to be a master of everything?

However, it\'s crucial to move beyond fixed roles and recognize the diverse skills and abilities each team member brings to the table. One area that deserves attention in this discussion is the role of testers within cross-functional teams.\\n\\n![business man holding mask](/img/mask-3829017_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n**Breaking the Mold: Testers in Cross-Functional Teams**\\n\\nTraditionally, there has been a debate about whether dedicated testers are necessary in agile and cross-functional teams. Some argue that every team member should be adept at testing, blurring the lines between roles. However, a more nuanced perspective acknowledges the unique expertise that testers bring to the development process.\\n\\n**Complementary Strengths: The Tester\'s Contribution**\\n\\nIn a comprehensive approach to team dynamics, the focus is on building teams with a mix of skills tailored to specific goals. Testers, with their specialized knowledge in quality assurance and testing methodologies, play a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of the software. Their ability to identify and address potential issues adds a layer of quality that may be challenging for a non-specialist to replicate.\\n\\n**Dispelling Misunderstandings: Testing as a Specialized Skill**\\n\\nOne common misunderstanding within discussions about cross-functional teams is the belief that every team member needs to be equally skilled in every aspect of software development. This misconception can lead to inflexible views on how teams work and hinder their potential. Acknowledging testing as a specialized skill dispels the notion that all team members need to be testing experts. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of collaboration, where testers and developers work together to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\\n\\n**People-Centric Collaboration: Recognizing Individual Competencies**\\n\\nShifting the conversation from rigid roles to celebrating individuals and their capabilities is particularly relevant when discussing testers. By recognizing the unique skills that testers bring, teams can foster a collaborative culture where the focus is on complementing strengths rather than conforming to a one-size-fits-all approach.\\n\\n**Fostering Innovation: The Tester\'s Role in Building Quality Software**\\n\\nIn the pursuit of innovation, having a dedicated focus on quality is paramount. Testers contribute to this by conducting thorough testing, identifying potential risks, and ensuring that the software meets the highest standards. Embracing a mix of skills, including the specialized expertise of testers, allows teams to create innovative solutions without compromising on quality.\\n\\n**Conclusion: Celebrating Diversity for Collaborative Success**\\n\\nIn the ever-changing landscape of software development, the emphasis should be on recognizing and celebrating the diverse skills within cross-functional teams. Testers, with their unique expertise, play a vital role in enhancing the overall quality of the software. By dispelling the misunderstanding that cross-functional teams must have equal expertise in every area, teams can foster a culture that values individual competencies, truly embracing the richness that a diverse mix of skills brings to collaborative efforts. It\'s time to appreciate the integral role of testers and move towards a more inclusive and effective approach to cross-functional team dynamics."},{"id":"customer-know-best","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/customer-know-best","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-14-customer-knows-best.mdx","title":"Does Customer Knows Best?","description":"Unlock the true potential of your ongoing software projects by embracing the richness of customer diversity.

This diversity poses a significant challenge in transforming their input into concrete requirements.\\n\\n*Action Point 1: Acknowledging Diversity*\\n- Recognize and appreciate the diversity within the customer group.\\n- Understand that each stakeholder brings a unique set of goals, expectations, and constraints to the table.\\n\\n*Action Point 2: Stakeholder Mapping*\\n- Develop a comprehensive stakeholder map, identifying different departments, roles, and levels within the organization.\\n- Use this map to visualize and understand the diverse perspectives that need to be reconciled during the requirements engineering process.\\n\\n**Goals vs. Requirements**\\n\\nWhile the adage \\"customer knows best\\" emphasizes the importance of customer input in requirements engineering, it\'s crucial to discern between high-level goals and concrete requirements. Customers often express overarching aspirations like \\"increase efficiency\\" or \\"improve user satisfaction.\\" However, these aspirations lack the specificity required for effective software development.\\n\\nA common challenge arises when customers, in an attempt to articulate their goals, inadvertently propose requirements that may not effectively fulfill those aspirations. This gap underscores the need for guidance in translating broad goals into tangible, actionable requirements.\\n\\n_Action Point 3: Goal-to-Requirement Translation_\\n\\n- Establish a structured process for translating overarching goals into specific and measurable requirements.\\n- Engage in collaborative workshops with stakeholders to distill broad goals into requirements that directly contribute to achieving those goals.\\n\\n_Action Point 4: Customer Guidance on Requirement Formulation_\\n\\n- Facilitate open communication with customers to ensure a clear understanding of their goals and expectations.\\n- Provide guidance to customers in formulating requirements that align with and effectively contribute to achieving their stated goals.\\n\\nBy differentiating between goals and requirements and offering guidance in the translation process, the development team can ensure that the final set of requirements not only captures customer aspirations accurately but also lays the groundwork for a successful and goal-oriented software development process.\\n\\n**Conflicting Goals and Priorities**\\n\\nThe existence of conflicting goals and priorities within the customer group further complicates the process. Different departments may have divergent objectives, and individual stakeholders may prioritize features differently based on their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\n*Action Point 5: Open Communication and Negotiation*\\n- Foster an environment of open communication between development teams and customers.\\n- Initiate regular check-ins and feedback sessions to identify and address conflicting goals and priorities.\\n- Establish a framework for negotiation and compromise that aligns with the overarching project objectives.\\n\\n**The Importance of Collaboration**\\n\\nTo overcome the challenges posed by the diversity of customer perspectives, effective collaboration between development teams and customers is paramount.\\n\\n*Action Point 6: Collaborative Techniques*\\n- Utilize collaborative techniques such as workshops, interviews, and prototyping to facilitate a shared understanding of requirements.\\n- Ensure that all stakeholders have a platform to voice their concerns and actively participate in the requirements engineering process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the customer\'s input remains invaluable in the requirements engineering process, it is crucial to move beyond the simplistic notion that \\"customer knows best.\\" By acknowledging diversity, translating goals into requirements, addressing conflicting priorities, and fostering collaboration, development teams can navigate the complexities inherent in customer knowledge within the ongoing context of their projects.\\n\\n**Reading Recommendation**\\n\\n - \\"Discovering Requirements: How to Specify Products and Services\\", book by Ian F.

The inevitable dawn of quality issues prompts a concerted effort to address testing challenges in a complex setup. However, in the urgency to salvage the project, the critical aspect of thorough and qualitative planning, with the objective of \\"building quality in,\\" often takes a back seat.\\n\\nWhen faced with unexpected quality issues in a complex setup involving \\n- multiple development teams, \\n- customizers, and\\n- a diverse customer base,\\n\\norganizations are compelled to navigate through coordinated testing challenges.\\n\\n![a team solving a puzzle](/img/integration-1777536_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n## The Pitfalls of Testing Dynamics\\n\\n**Lack of Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nIn complex setups, there is often an overarching sense of \\"quality,\\" but primarily from a strategic perspective. The challenge arises from a lack of a unified test concept, as each team operates with its own testers under the charge of team leads, without a detailed test strategy covering the entirety of the software.\\n\\n**Missing \\"One Team\\" Sense in Testing**\\n\\nThe decentralized nature of testing across various teams and customizers contributes to a challenge in fostering a \\"one team\\" sense in testing. Each team may have its own quality assurance focus, leading to potential blind spots and overlooking critical interactions between components.\\n\\n**Coordinating Test Efforts**\\n\\nThe coordination of testing efforts becomes a challenge when decentralized teams operate with varied testing approaches. This dynamic makes it more difficult to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive testing strategy that spans the entire software architecture.\\n\\n**Insufficient Cross-Team Communication**\\n\\nThe absence of a unified test concept often translates into challenges related to cross-team communication. This siloed approach hampers the identification and resolution of cross-functional issues that can significantly impact the end-user experience.\\n\\n## The Tester\'s Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights\\n\\nTo address the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups, it is crucial to elevate the voice of testers from all teams. Their insights and perspectives should be not only valued but celebrated, as they contribute to the creation of a powerful and consolidated image of the software\'s testing needs.\\n\\n**A Collaborative Approach**\\n\\nRather than relying on top-down decisions, embrace a collaborative approach where the voices of individual testers are heard, fostering a stronger sense of identification with the testing process. This not only enhances the quality of testing strategies but also empowers teams to take charge of their testing journey.\\n\\n**The Importance of Listening**\\n\\nListening to testers from diverse teams is not just about hearing their opinions; it\'s about acknowledging their unique insights and experiences. This approach empowers testers to shape the testing process, enriching it by uncovering potential blind spots and ensuring that the entire software architecture is thoroughly examined.\\n\\n## Empowering Teams\\n\\nEmpower teams with the autonomy to _shape_ their testing strategies. This not only builds a more resilient and effective testing framework but also instills a sense of ownership. When team members actively contribute to the planning and execution of testing efforts, their identification with the process becomes a powerful force.\\n\\n**A Holistic Approach Across Complex Setups**\\n\\nIn complex setups involving multiple development teams, customizers, and a diverse customer base, the \\"build quality in\\" approach should transcend individual responsibilities. Quality assurance should not be the sole responsibility of specific teams; instead, it should be an overarching principle embraced by every stakeholder in the process.\\n\\n**Building Quality In: A Collective Empowerment**\\n\\nRecognizing that quality cannot be tested into a product only after development but must be an intrinsic part of the entire chain is pivotal. Each development team, customizer, and customer plays a crucial role in this collective empowerment to build quality into the software from the ground up.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment\\nWhile the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups may be intricate, it is imperative to recognize that the aftermath of quality issues demands more than a rushed search for test resources. The true solution lies in fostering a culture of qualitative planning, a collective commitment to building quality in, and an empowering environment where every tester\'s voice is not only heard but celebrated. This proactive approach not only mitigates risks but also lays the foundation for delivering software that stands the test of time.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps to Forge Unified Testing Success in Complex Environments\\n\\nHere\'s a short action list on how to overcome the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups and empower testing excellence:\\n\\n**1. Establish a Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nDevelop a comprehensive test concept that spans the entire software architecture. Ensure that every team, including customizers and stakeholders, contributes to and aligns with this unified vision for testing.\\n\\n**2.

Imagine this: instead of really digging into the software, a tester just goes through a set list of tests, checking boxes as they go. It might look like progress, but it\'s like scratching the surface without getting to the real stuff.\\n\\n![human finger touches robot finger](/img/tester-vs-bot.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n**The Ritual**\\n\\nPicture this as a ritual: a tester follows a set path, just ticking off boxes with specific inputs and expected results. It\'s like a dance, but instead of exploring the software\'s ins and outs, it\'s more like going through the motions.\\n\\n**The Misleading Idea**\\n\\nLet\'s clear something up: just ticking boxes doesn\'t equal effective testing. It might seem like things are getting done, but it doesn\'t go deep enough to find the hidden problems in the code.\\n\\n**Going Beyond**\\n\\nSoftware testing is an art. It\'s not just about following a script; it\'s about actively thinking and engaging with the software. Real testers don\'t stick to the script \u2013 they go off the beaten path, checking every corner for potential issues.\\n\\n**More Than Just Checking Boxes**\\n\\nGood testers don\'t rely only on checkboxes in a test execution plan. They bring in critical thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of how the software works. Thorough testing means crafting tests that go beyond the obvious, thinking ahead, and making sure every part of the software gets a good look.\\n\\n**The Danger of Robotic Testing**\\n\\nWhen testing becomes mindless checkbox ticking, it\'s like being stuck in robot mode. The line between a real tester and an automated bot starts to blur. The human touch \u2013 the ability to adapt, think creatively, and find tricky issues \u2013 disappears.\\n\\n**Conclusion: Embracing  The Quality Journey**\\n\\nIn software testing, it\'s not just about getting through a checklist. It\'s a journey, a quest to really understand what makes the software tick. Let\'s move past the routine and embrace the heart of testing \u2013 an ever-evolving process that separates the real testers from the software bots.\\n\\n:::danger The Role of Regression Tests\\n\\nWhile advocating for a holistic approach and  the importance of moving beyond checkbox testing to truly understand and engage with software, it is crucial to acknowledge the value of reliable regression tests.\\n\\n**It is the combination of thoughtful, exploratory testing and robust regression testing that forms the backbone of a comprehensive quality assurance strategy.**   \\n\\nStriking this balance ensures not only the uncovering of new issues but also the preservation of the stability and reliability of the software over time. \\n\\nBe aware to recognize the moment to introduce automation into your testing strategy as a key consideration for maintaining an effective and efficient software testing process.\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"how","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/how","source":"@site/i18n/de/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2022-12-01-how-i-became-a-tester.md","title":"Wie man Software Tester wird","description":"Dar\xfcber, wie man Software Tester wird","date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"1.

Sie war spezialisiert auf Software f\xfcr einen kleinen Markt im Rundfunkbereich. Die Software war sehr modular, hoch konfigurierbar and reich an Schnittstellen - entweder zu unseren eigenen Modulen oder zu Drittherstellern.\\n\\nMein Job war es, bei unsren Kunden vor Ort im Rahmen von Einf\xfchrungsprojekten, die Software zu installieren, zu konfigurieren und in Betrieb zu nehmen. Weiterhin stellte ich vom B\xfcro aus den Remote-Support sicher. Traten im Betrieb Fehler auf, war ich die erste Anlaufstelle f\xfcr den Kunden. \\n\\nZu dieser Zeit gab es in meinem Team weder einen Tester oder einen Testprozess. Es gab auch keinen klar definierten Releaseprozess. Die Entwickler testeten selber, sendeten Debug-Versionen (all in one *.exe Dateien) per E-Mail zum Kunden. Der Kunde probierte es dann aus und nahm die Version in Betrieb.\\n\\nDies war mein erster Kontakt mit einem Mantra, welches mich bis heute begleitet:\\n\\n> **\\"Der Kunde testet selbst! Er weiss ja am Besten, wie es funktionieren muss!\\"**\\n\\nWenn ich wieder im Support B\xfcro vor unserem Webportal sass, bekam ich dann aber irgendwie einen anderen Eindruck. Wenn der Kunde doch wusste, wie es funktionieren muss, warum nahm er dann immer wieder Versionen in Betrieb, die nach mehr oder eher weniger langer Betriebszeit Fehler verursachten?\\n\\nUnd warum waren die Kunden dann trotzdem so sauer und beschwerten sich \xfcber die Qualit\xe4t? Sie hatten diese doch selber gepr\xfcft. Mit ihren eigenen Gesch\xe4ftsprozessen. Und f\xfcr gut empfunden? Sonst h\xe4tten sie Version doch nicht in Betrieb genommen, oder?\\n\\nOkay, f\xfcr den Unterschied zwischen \\"testen\\" und \\"probieren\\" ben\xf6tigt es dann wohl mal einen eigenen Post... \\n\\nIch war es in jedem Fall leid, bei den Kunden st\xe4ndig Besserung zu geloben. Schlussendlich, waren es sicher auch unsere Kunden leid, mir das jedes Mal wieder aufs Neue zu glauben.\\n\\nNun hatte auch dieses kleine Software-Entwicklungs-Team schon einmal etwas vom Konzept des unabh\xe4ngigen Testens geh\xf6rt. Also Software vor der Auslieferung an den Kunden von einer zweiten Instanz (neben dem Entwickler selbst) testen zu lassen.\\n\\nIch fand das Thema sofort spannend. W\xfcrde es mir doch erm\xf6glichen, mich noch intensiver mit der Funktionsweise der Software auseinanderzusetzen. Auch w\xe4re ich dann im Support bei der Beantwortung der Fragen kompetenter. Wir w\xfcrden Fehler fr\xfcher finden. Wir w\xfcrden lernen, die Gesch\xe4ftsprozesse des Kunden besser zu verstehen. Alles in allem, auch eine bessere Qualit\xe4t liefern.\\n\\nSo begann also meine Karriere als Software Tester. Eine spannende Aufgabe mit viel Aufbauarbeit und einer steilen Lernkurve. \\n\\nPS:\\n\\nDas Testen in einem Team mit 5  - 6 Entwicklern is kein Teilzeitjob. Und ich hatte ja noch die anderen Aufgaben. Als dann die Auftragslage im Projektbereich wieder anzog, wurde mir klar, dass der Fokus nun wieder dorthin verlagert werden w\xfcrde.  Ich w\xfcrde so noch weniger Zeit f\xfcr das haben, was mir lieb geworden war. Somit entschloss ich mich, mich auch einen neuen Weg zu begeben und mich von nun an als Software Tester zu verdingen."}]}')}}]);
