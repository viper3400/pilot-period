Discover how acknowledging varied goals and distinguishing between aspirations and requirements can reshape your development journey. It\'s time to move beyond the one-size-fits-all approach and foster a collaborative environment that transforms customer input into a tailored roadmap for success.***\\n\\nIn the dynamic realm of software development, the maxim \\"customer knows best\\" has long been a guiding principle in requirements engineering. \\nHowever, as we navigate ongoing projects with a sense that they could benefit from a reevaluation, it becomes evident that assuming a singular, \\nall-knowing customer is a myth that can complicate rather than facilitate effective software development.\\n\\nThis article seeks to delve into the challenges arising from the assumption of homogeneous customer knowledge and proposes actionable strategies to address these complexities within the context of projects that may require a recalibration.\\n\\n![a burning dart](/img/dart-1943313_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [MasterTux](https://pixabay.com/de/users/mastertux-470906/)_\\n\\n**The Myth of Homogeneous Customer Knowledge**\\n\\nThe potential pitfall of adhering too strictly to the \\"customer knows best\\" mantra lies in the assumption of a uniform customer knowledge base. In reality, customers often constitute a diverse group with varying goals, perspectives, and priorities. This diversity poses a significant challenge in transforming their input into concrete requirements.\\n\\n*Action Point 1: Acknowledging Diversity*\\n- Recognize and appreciate the diversity within the customer group.\\n- Understand that each stakeholder brings a unique set of goals, expectations, and constraints to the table.\\n\\n*Action Point 2: Stakeholder Mapping*\\n- Develop a comprehensive stakeholder map, identifying different departments, roles, and levels within the organization.\\n- Use this map to visualize and understand the diverse perspectives that need to be reconciled during the requirements engineering process.\\n\\n**Goals vs. Requirements**\\n\\nWhile the adage \\"customer knows best\\" emphasizes the importance of customer input in requirements engineering, it\'s crucial to discern between high-level goals and concrete requirements. Customers often express overarching aspirations like \\"increase efficiency\\" or \\"improve user satisfaction.\\" However, these aspirations lack the specificity required for effective software development.\\n\\nA common challenge arises when customers, in an attempt to articulate their goals, inadvertently propose requirements that may not effectively fulfill those aspirations. This gap underscores the need for guidance in translating broad goals into tangible, actionable requirements.\\n\\n_Action Point 3: Goal-to-Requirement Translation_\\n\\n- Establish a structured process for translating overarching goals into specific and measurable requirements.\\n- Engage in collaborative workshops with stakeholders to distill broad goals into requirements that directly contribute to achieving those goals.\\n\\n_Action Point 4: Customer Guidance on Requirement Formulation_\\n\\n- Facilitate open communication with customers to ensure a clear understanding of their goals and expectations.\\n- Provide guidance to customers in formulating requirements that align with and effectively contribute to achieving their stated goals.\\n\\nBy differentiating between goals and requirements and offering guidance in the translation process, the development team can ensure that the final set of requirements not only captures customer aspirations accurately but also lays the groundwork for a successful and goal-oriented software development process.\\n\\n**Conflicting Goals and Priorities**\\n\\nThe existence of conflicting goals and priorities within the customer group further complicates the process. Different departments may have divergent objectives, and individual stakeholders may prioritize features differently based on their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\n*Action Point 5: Open Communication and Negotiation*\\n- Foster an environment of open communication between development teams and customers.\\n- Initiate regular check-ins and feedback sessions to identify and address conflicting goals and priorities.\\n- Establish a framework for negotiation and compromise that aligns with the overarching project objectives.\\n\\n**The Importance of Collaboration**\\n\\nTo overcome the challenges posed by the diversity of customer perspectives, effective collaboration between development teams and customers is paramount.\\n\\n*Action Point 6: Collaborative Techniques*\\n- Utilize collaborative techniques such as workshops, interviews, and prototyping to facilitate a shared understanding of requirements.\\n- Ensure that all stakeholders have a platform to voice their concerns and actively participate in the requirements engineering process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the customer\'s input remains invaluable in the requirements engineering process, it is crucial to move beyond the simplistic notion that \\"customer knows best.\\" By acknowledging diversity, translating goals into requirements, addressing conflicting priorities, and fostering collaboration, development teams can navigate the complexities inherent in customer knowledge within the ongoing context of their projects.\\n\\n**Reading Recommendation**\\n\\n - \\"Discovering Requirements: How to Specify Products and Services\\", book by Ian F.

The inevitable dawn of quality issues prompts a concerted effort to address testing challenges in a complex setup. However, in the urgency to salvage the project, the critical aspect of thorough and qualitative planning, with the objective of \\"building quality in,\\" often takes a back seat.\\n\\nWhen faced with unexpected quality issues in a complex setup involving \\n- multiple development teams, \\n- customizers, and\\n- a diverse customer base,\\n\\norganizations are compelled to navigate through coordinated testing challenges.\\n\\n![a team solving a puzzle](/img/integration-1777536_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n## The Pitfalls of Testing Dynamics\\n\\n**Lack of Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nIn complex setups, there is often an overarching sense of \\"quality,\\" but primarily from a strategic perspective. The challenge arises from a lack of a unified test concept, as each team operates with its own testers under the charge of team leads, without a detailed test strategy covering the entirety of the software.\\n\\n**Missing \\"One Team\\" Sense in Testing**\\n\\nThe decentralized nature of testing across various teams and customizers contributes to a challenge in fostering a \\"one team\\" sense in testing. Each team may have its own quality assurance focus, leading to potential blind spots and overlooking critical interactions between components.\\n\\n**Coordinating Test Efforts**\\n\\nThe coordination of testing efforts becomes a challenge when decentralized teams operate with varied testing approaches. This dynamic makes it more difficult to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive testing strategy that spans the entire software architecture.\\n\\n**Insufficient Cross-Team Communication**\\n\\nThe absence of a unified test concept often translates into challenges related to cross-team communication. This siloed approach hampers the identification and resolution of cross-functional issues that can significantly impact the end-user experience.\\n\\n## The Tester\'s Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights\\n\\nTo address the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups, it is crucial to elevate the voice of testers from all teams. Their insights and perspectives should be not only valued but celebrated, as they contribute to the creation of a powerful and consolidated image of the software\'s testing needs.\\n\\n**A Collaborative Approach**\\n\\nRather than relying on top-down decisions, embrace a collaborative approach where the voices of individual testers are heard, fostering a stronger sense of identification with the testing process. This not only enhances the quality of testing strategies but also empowers teams to take charge of their testing journey.\\n\\n**The Importance of Listening**\\n\\nListening to testers from diverse teams is not just about hearing their opinions; it\'s about acknowledging their unique insights and experiences. This approach empowers testers to shape the testing process, enriching it by uncovering potential blind spots and ensuring that the entire software architecture is thoroughly examined.\\n\\n## Empowering Teams\\n\\nEmpower teams with the autonomy to _shape_ their testing strategies. This not only builds a more resilient and effective testing framework but also instills a sense of ownership. When team members actively contribute to the planning and execution of testing efforts, their identification with the process becomes a powerful force.\\n\\n**A Holistic Approach Across Complex Setups**\\n\\nIn complex setups involving multiple development teams, customizers, and a diverse customer base, the \\"build quality in\\" approach should transcend individual responsibilities. Quality assurance should not be the sole responsibility of specific teams; instead, it should be an overarching principle embraced by every stakeholder in the process.\\n\\n**Building Quality In: A Collective Empowerment**\\n\\nRecognizing that quality cannot be tested into a product only after development but must be an intrinsic part of the entire chain is pivotal. Each development team, customizer, and customer plays a crucial role in this collective empowerment to build quality into the software from the ground up.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment\\nWhile the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups may be intricate, it is imperative to recognize that the aftermath of quality issues demands more than a rushed search for test resources. The true solution lies in fostering a culture of qualitative planning, a collective commitment to building quality in, and an empowering environment where every tester\'s voice is not only heard but celebrated. This proactive approach not only mitigates risks but also lays the foundation for delivering software that stands the test of time.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps to Forge Unified Testing Success in Complex Environments\\n\\nHere\'s a short action list on how to overcome the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups and empower testing excellence:\\n\\n**1. Establish a Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nDevelop a comprehensive test concept that spans the entire software architecture. Ensure that every team, including customizers and stakeholders, contributes to and aligns with this unified vision for testing.\\n\\n**2.

Imagine this: instead of really digging into the software, a tester just goes through a set list of tests, checking boxes as they go. It might look like progress, but it\'s like scratching the surface without getting to the real stuff.\\n\\n![human finger touches robot finger](/img/tester-vs-bot.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n**The Ritual**\\n\\nPicture this as a ritual: a tester follows a set path, just ticking off boxes with specific inputs and expected results. It\'s like a dance, but instead of exploring the software\'s ins and outs, it\'s more like going through the motions.\\n\\n**The Misleading Idea**\\n\\nLet\'s clear something up: just ticking boxes doesn\'t equal effective testing. It might seem like things are getting done, but it doesn\'t go deep enough to find the hidden problems in the code.\\n\\n**Going Beyond**\\n\\nSoftware testing is an art. It\'s not just about following a script; it\'s about actively thinking and engaging with the software. Real testers don\'t stick to the script \u2013 they go off the beaten path, checking every corner for potential issues.\\n\\n**More Than Just Checking Boxes**\\n\\nGood testers don\'t rely only on checkboxes in a test execution plan. They bring in critical thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of how the software works. Thorough testing means crafting tests that go beyond the obvious, thinking ahead, and making sure every part of the software gets a good look.\\n\\n**The Danger of Robotic Testing**\\n\\nWhen testing becomes mindless checkbox ticking, it\'s like being stuck in robot mode. The line between a real tester and an automated bot starts to blur. The human touch \u2013 the ability to adapt, think creatively, and find tricky issues \u2013 disappears.\\n\\n**Conclusion: Embracing  The Quality Journey**\\n\\nIn software testing, it\'s not just about getting through a checklist. It\'s a journey, a quest to really understand what makes the software tick. Let\'s move past the routine and embrace the heart of testing \u2013 an ever-evolving process that separates the real testers from the software bots.\\n\\n:::danger The Role of Regression Tests\\n\\nWhile advocating for a holistic approach and  the importance of moving beyond checkbox testing to truly understand and engage with software, it is crucial to acknowledge the value of reliable regression tests.\\n\\n**It is the combination of thoughtful, exploratory testing and robust regression testing that forms the backbone of a comprehensive quality assurance strategy.**   \\n\\nStriking this balance ensures not only the uncovering of new issues but also the preservation of the stability and reliability of the software over time. \\n\\nBe aware to recognize the moment to introduce automation into your testing strategy as a key consideration for maintaining an effective and efficient software testing process.\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"how","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/how","source":"@site/i18n/de/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2022-12-01-how-i-became-a-tester.md","title":"Wie man Software Tester wird","description":"Dar\xfcber, wie man Software Tester wird","date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"1.

Sie war spezialisiert auf Software f\xfcr einen kleinen Markt im Rundfunkbereich. Die Software war sehr modular, hoch konfigurierbar and reich an Schnittstellen - entweder zu unseren eigenen Modulen oder zu Drittherstellern.\\n\\nMein Job war es, bei unsren Kunden vor Ort im Rahmen von Einf\xfchrungsprojekten, die Software zu installieren, zu konfigurieren und in Betrieb zu nehmen. Weiterhin stellte ich vom B\xfcro aus den Remote-Support sicher. Traten im Betrieb Fehler auf, war ich die erste Anlaufstelle f\xfcr den Kunden. \\n\\nZu dieser Zeit gab es in meinem Team weder einen Tester oder einen Testprozess. Es gab auch keinen klar definierten Releaseprozess. Die Entwickler testeten selber, sendeten Debug-Versionen (all in one *.exe Dateien) per E-Mail zum Kunden. Der Kunde probierte es dann aus und nahm die Version in Betrieb.\\n\\nDies war mein erster Kontakt mit einem Mantra, welches mich bis heute begleitet:\\n\\n> **\\"Der Kunde testet selbst! Er weiss ja am Besten, wie es funktionieren muss!\\"**\\n\\nWenn ich wieder im Support B\xfcro vor unserem Webportal sass, bekam ich dann aber irgendwie einen anderen Eindruck. Wenn der Kunde doch wusste, wie es funktionieren muss, warum nahm er dann immer wieder Versionen in Betrieb, die nach mehr oder eher weniger langer Betriebszeit Fehler verursachten?\\n\\nUnd warum waren die Kunden dann trotzdem so sauer und beschwerten sich \xfcber die Qualit\xe4t? Sie hatten diese doch selber gepr\xfcft. Mit ihren eigenen Gesch\xe4ftsprozessen. Und f\xfcr gut empfunden? Sonst h\xe4tten sie Version doch nicht in Betrieb genommen, oder?\\n\\nOkay, f\xfcr den Unterschied zwischen \\"testen\\" und \\"probieren\\" ben\xf6tigt es dann wohl mal einen eigenen Post... \\n\\nIch war es in jedem Fall leid, bei den Kunden st\xe4ndig Besserung zu geloben. Schlussendlich, waren es sicher auch unsere Kunden leid, mir das jedes Mal wieder aufs Neue zu glauben.\\n\\nNun hatte auch dieses kleine Software-Entwicklungs-Team schon einmal etwas vom Konzept des unabh\xe4ngigen Testens geh\xf6rt. Also Software vor der Auslieferung an den Kunden von einer zweiten Instanz (neben dem Entwickler selbst) testen zu lassen.\\n\\nIch fand das Thema sofort spannend. W\xfcrde es mir doch erm\xf6glichen, mich noch intensiver mit der Funktionsweise der Software auseinanderzusetzen. Auch w\xe4re ich dann im Support bei der Beantwortung der Fragen kompetenter. Wir w\xfcrden Fehler fr\xfcher finden. Wir w\xfcrden lernen, die Gesch\xe4ftsprozesse des Kunden besser zu verstehen. Alles in allem, auch eine bessere Qualit\xe4t liefern.\\n\\nSo begann also meine Karriere als Software Tester. Eine spannende Aufgabe mit viel Aufbauarbeit und einer steilen Lernkurve. \\n\\nPS:\\n\\nDas Testen in einem Team mit 5  - 6 Entwicklern is kein Teilzeitjob. Und ich hatte ja noch die anderen Aufgaben. Als dann die Auftragslage im Projektbereich wieder anzog, wurde mir klar, dass der Fokus nun wieder dorthin verlagert werden w\xfcrde.  Ich w\xfcrde so noch weniger Zeit f\xfcr das haben, was mir lieb geworden war. Somit entschloss ich mich, mich auch einen neuen Weg zu begeben und mich von nun an als Software Tester zu verdingen."}]}')}}]);
