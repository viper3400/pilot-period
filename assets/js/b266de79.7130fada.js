It won\u2019t be followed by a weekly stream of insights or tidy summaries of what I\u2019ve been working on.\\nIt\u2019s simply the one piece I\u2019ll leave here for 2025 - a marker, a provocation, and a nod to the people who keep the craft alive while the rest of us drift in and out.\\n\\nAnd as the next year unfolds, I hope for more of what tech culture desperately needs: sharper thinking, deeper curiosity, and fewer performative updates.\\nMay 2026  reward those who build with intent, write with integrity, and ignore the pressure to chase trends for the sake of visibility.\\n\\nThis space will likely stay quiet.

Say goodbye to clutter and hello to clarity with Serenity/JS\'s Actor Notepads! Learn how to inject user credentials seamlessly for cleaner, more maintainable tests. Ready to dive in?**\\n\\n## Actors in Serenity/JS\\n\\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) is a testing framework that promotes collaboration, clarity, and maintainability in automated testing. At its core, Serenity/JS introduces the concept of actors, which represent the different users or personas interacting with a web application. Actors are equipped with capabilities and context, allowing them to perform actions and interact with the application under test.\\n\\n![Serenity/JS](/img/serenity-js-social-card.jpg)\\n\\n## Introducing Actor Notepads\\nA key feature of Serenity/JS is the concept of actor notepads. Notepads serve as containers for actor-specific data, such as credentials, expected outcomes, and any other contextual information relevant to the test scenario. Instead of cluttering test scripts with data setup details, actor notepads encapsulate this information within the actor itself.\\n\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nLet\'s assume a small test where an actor:\\n- Navigates to the login page of the application (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login).\\n- Enters the username retrieved from the actor\'s notepad into the username input field on the login page.\\n- Enters the password retrieved from the actor\'s notepad into the password input field on the login page.\\n- Clicks on the login button to submit the credentials.\\n- Waits until a flash message appears on the page, indicating a successful login, with the expected result retrieved from the actor\'s notepad.\\n\\nFirst, we prepare two actors called Tom Smith, who is allowed to login and Jan Doe, who is not allowed to login.\\nWe put their login credentials and expected result into their notepads, using the ability to [TakeNotes](https://serenity-js.org/api/core/class/TakeNotes/).\\n\\n```typescript\\n// To avoid typos and repetition when instantiating and retrieving actors, \\n// we use string enums to store actor names:\\nenum ActorNames {\\n    Tom = \'Tom Smith, who is allowed to use our system,\',\\n    Jane = \'Jane Doe, who is not allowed to use our system,\'\\n}\\n\\n// We are using a model for our actors notepad\\ntype FormAuthenticationModel = {\\n    Username: string,\\n    Password: string,\\n    ExpectedResult: string\\n}\\n\\nclass AuthenticationActors implements Cast {\\n    constructor(private readonly browser: Browser) {\\n    }\\n\\n    // Prepare method to configure actors with specific capabilities and data\\n    prepare(actor: Actor): Actor {\\n        // Initialize the actor with the capability to browse the web using Playwright\\n        let preparedActor = actor.whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(this.browser));\\n\\n        // Switch statement to customize actor based on their name\\n        switch (actor.name) {\\n            // Configuration for actor named Tom\\n            case ActorNames.Tom: {\\n                // Configure actor to take notes using a notepad with specific authentication data\\n                preparedActor = preparedActor.whoCan(\\n                    TakeNotes.using(Notepad.with<FormAuthenticationModel>({\\n                        Username: \'tomsmith\',\\n                        Password: \'SuperSecretPassword!\',\\n                        ExpectedResult: \'You logged into a secure area!\'\\n                    }))\\n                );\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            // Configuration for actor named Jane\\n            case ActorNames.Jane: {\\n                // Configure actor to take notes using a notepad with specific authentication data\\n                preparedActor = preparedActor.whoCan(\\n                    TakeNotes.using(Notepad.with<FormAuthenticationModel>({\\n                        Username: \'janedoe\',\\n                        Password: \'WrongPassword!\',\\n                        ExpectedResult: \'Your username is invalid!\'\\n                    }))\\n                );\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // Return the prepared actor with customized capabilities and data\\n        return preparedActor;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor our test we have to prepare the `PageElements` and a `Task`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nclass FormAuthenticationPage {\\n    static UserNameInputField = PageElement.located(By.css(\'#username\')).describedAs(\'field to input the username\')\\n    static PasswordInputField = PageElement.located(By.css(\'#password\')).describedAs(\'field to input the password\')\\n    static LoginButton = PageElement.located(By.css(\'[type=\\"submit\\"]\')).describedAs(\'button to login\')\\n    static FlashMessage = PageElement.located(By.css(\'#flash\')).describedAs(\'result message\')\\n}\\n\\nconst LoginToAppUsingActorsNotepad = () => \\n    Task.where(`#actor logs in using username and password from their notepad`,\\n        Navigate.to(\'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login\'),\\n        Enter.theValue(notes<FormAuthenticationModel>().get(\'Username\')).into(FormAuthenticationPage.UserNameInputField),\\n        Enter.theValue(notes<FormAuthenticationModel>().get(\'Password\')).into(FormAuthenticationPage.PasswordInputField),\\n        Click.on(FormAuthenticationPage.LoginButton),\\n        Wait.until(Text.of(FormAuthenticationPage.FlashMessage), includes(notes<FormAuthenticationModel>().get(\'ExpectedResult\')))\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nFinally, when using Serenity/JS with Playwright Test our spec looks like:\\n\\n```typescript\\n//make sure to import { describe, it, test } from \'@serenity-js/playwright-test\'\\n\\ndescribe(\'form authentication notepad\', () => {\\n    test.use({\\n        \\n        /*\\n         * Override the default cast of actors, \\n         * so that each actor receives their own,\\n         * independent browser window.\\n         */\\n        actors: async ({ browser }, use) => {\\n            use(new AuthenticationActors(browser));\\n        },\\n    });\\n    describe(\'login page\', () => {\\n        it(\'should log in with correct username and password\', async ({ actorCalled }) => {\\n            await actorCalled(ActorNames.Tom).attemptsTo(\\n                LoginToAppUsingActorsNotepad(),\\n            )\\n        })\\n\\n        it(\'should deny login with incorrect username and password\', async ({ actorCalled }) => {\\n            await actorCalled(ActorNames.Jane).attemptsTo(\\n                LoginToAppUsingActorsNotepad(),\\n            )\\n        })\\n\\n    })\\n})\\n```\\nTo start right away with Serenity/JS using Playwright test I recommend to use a [Serenity/JS template](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/#playwright).\\n\\n## Advantages of Using Actor Notepads\\n\\n- **Separation of Concerns:** By delegating data setup to actor notepads, test scripts focus solely on orchestrating actor actions, leading to cleaner and more readable code.\\n\\n- **Encapsulation:** Actor notepads encapsulate actor-specific data, promoting better organization and reducing the likelihood of data misuse or modification.\\n\\n- **Reusability:** Actor notepads facilitate the reuse of actors across multiple tests without duplicating data setup logic, improving test maintainability and reducing code duplication.\\n\\n- **Scalability:** As test suites grow, managing data setup through actor notepads proves more scalable and manageable than injecting data through parameters.\\n\\n- **Enhanced Reporting:** Serenity/JS emphasizes descriptive and readable test reports. Actor notepads enable better reporting by associating test steps with relevant actor context, enhancing test comprehensibility.\\n\\n- **Flexibility for Extension:** Actor notepads provide a flexible mechanism to extend actor capabilities or introduce additional data for testing purposes, without significantly modifying test script structure.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, leveraging actor notepads within Serenity/JS tranforms automated testing,\\noffering a streamlined approach to managing test data. By encapsulating test data within actors, \\ntest scripts become clearer, more maintainable, and less prone to errors.\\nWith the separation of concerns afforded by actor notepads, the focus shifts from data setup\\nto orchestrating meaningful test actions, resulting in enhanced readability and scalability."},{"id":"sjs-visual-wdio","metadata":{"permalink":"/sjs-visual-wdio","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-24-sjs-visual-wdio.mdx","title":"Level Up Your Serenity/JS Tests with WDIO Visual Regression Testing","description":"Don\'t let visual bugs slip through!

Clone the `serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template` [repository](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template):\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone git@github.com:serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template.git\\n```\\n\\n2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run:\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm test\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures your project is set up correctly.\\n\\n3. Install the visual testing support for WebdriverIO:\\n```bash\\nnpm install @wdio/visual-service --save-dev\\n```\\n\\nIf you encounter errors, check the system requirements for \\nvisual testing with WDIO [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing#system-requirements).\\n\\n4. Enable the visual service in your project\'s root directory file `wdio.conf.ts`:\\n\\n```ts title=\\"./wdio.conf.ts\\"\\n// Test runner services\\n// Services take over a specific job you don\'t want to take care of. They enhance\\n// your test setup with almost no effort. Unlike plugins, they don\'t add new\\n// commands. Instead, they hook themselves up into the test process.\\nservices: [ \'visual\' ],\\n```\\n\\n5. Update your project\'s root directory file `tsconfig.json` to include the necessary WDIO types:\\n\\n```json title=\\"./tsconfig.json\\"\\n{\\n    \\"compilerOptions\\": {\\n        \\"types\\": [\\n          ...\\n          \\"expect-webdriverio\\",\\n          \\"@wdio/visual-service\\"\\n        ],\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Creating Custom Interactions\\n\\nNow, let\'s create our custom Serenity/JS interactions:\\n\\n```typescript title=\\"./test/serenity/CustomInteractions.ts\\"\\nimport { Interaction, MetaQuestionAdapter } from \'@serenity-js/core\';\\nimport { PageElement } from \'@serenity-js/web\';\\n\\nexport const CompareScreen = (snapshotIdentifier: string) =>     \\n    Interaction.where(\'#actor compares whole page screenshot\', \\n        async actor => {\\n            return expect(browser).toMatchFullPageSnapshot(snapshotIdentifier)\\n        })\\n\\nexport const CompareElement = (\\n    pageElement: MetaQuestionAdapter<PageElement<unknown>, PageElement<unknown>>,\\n    snapshotIdentifier: string) =>     \\n    Interaction.where(\'#actor compares element screenshot\', \\n        async actor => {\\n            const selector = await pageElement.answeredBy(actor)\\n            return expect(selector.nativeElement())\\n                .toMatchElementSnapshot(snapshotIdentifier)\\n        }\\n    )\\n```\\n\\n:::info\\nThese custom interactions are designed specifically for Serenity/JS and **WDIO**.\\n\\nIf you\'re using **Playwright**, you\'ll need to implement interactions according to Playwright\'s approach to snapshots [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).\\n\\nA more comprehensive solution that integrates seamlessly with Serenity/JS and supports all browser automation tools would require additional development beyond this basic example.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Using the Interactions in Specs\\n\\nHere\'s how to use the interactions in your spec files:\\n\\n```ts title=\\"./specs/ui/todo/serenity-js_website.spec.ts\\"\\n it(`offers examples to help you practice test automation`, async () => {\\n        ...\\n        // Once we know the system is up and running, Wendy can proceed with the web-based scenario.\\n        await actorCalled(\'Wendy\').attemptsTo(\\n            TodoList.createListContaining([\\n                `Buy dog food`,\\n                `Feed the dog`,\\n                `Book a vet\'s appointment`,\\n            ]),\\n            CompareScreen(\'list_after_creation\'),\\n            TodoList.markAsCompleted([\\n                `Buy dog food`,\\n                `Feed the dog`,\\n            ]),\\n            CompareScreen(\'list_after_completion\'),\\n            Ensure.that(\\n                TodoList.outstandingItemsCount(),\\n                equals(1)\\n            ),\\n        )\\n    })\\n```\\n\\n\\n:::info Important Considerations\\n* Visual testing is not a silver bullet. Refer to the WebdriverIO page for key considerations for optimal use [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing/considerations).\\n* Choose meaningful names for your reference snapshots.

Say goodbye to redundant work and hello to efficient testing.***\\n\\nIn the [last tutorial](/sjs-playwright-ct), I showed how to do component testing using Serenity/JS and Playwright. To be honest, it\'s a very simple component, making it difficult to create a real-world example. Let\'s just assume it\'s a coffee counter for controlling how many cups of coffee you drink.\\n\\n![Serenity/JS](/img/serenity-js-social-card.jpg)\\n\\nComponent testing ensures that your self-contained components work as expected. For user acceptance, there may be some additional things necessary to verify functionality.\\n\\nThe good news is: You can reuse what you\'ve already prepared for the component tests and dive into the user scenarios.\\n\\nIn this article, I will demonstrate how we can integrate BDD scenarios into the project I prepared the last time. I will use Serenity/JS BDD features. These BDD scenarios will run in the same project like the component tests and will reuse Serenity/JS `PageElements` and `Tasks` that we already used in the component tests.\\n\\nI cloned the last example and updated all packages to the latest versions to be up to date and created a [new repository](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial). If you want to follow all the steps from scratch I suggest going back and starting with the [component testing tutorial](/sjs-playwright-ct) and coming back once you\'ve finished.\\n\\nTo start, you\'ve to add some additional dev dependencies to your project:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber \\nnpm install --save-dev @serenity-js/cucumber\\n```\\n\\n:::warning Mind the dependency versions!\\n\\nSerenity/JS is a monorepo and it\'s strictly recommended that all dependencies to the project have the same version. Here\'s the trap with my simple `npm install` approach, as this will always install the latest version, which might be incorrect.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThis time I will not list the file content in detail but refer to the repository and some explanations.\\n\\nKey to using BDD and Serenity/JS with cucumber is the [features folder](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/tree/main/features).\\n\\n```\\nfeatures\\n|- coffee-counter\\n|  |- coffee-counter.feature\\n|  \\\\- readme.md\\n|\\n|- step-definitions\\n|  |- counter.steps.ts\\n|  \\\\- parameter.steps.ts\\n|\\n|- support\\n|  |- Actors.ts\\n|  \\\\- serenity.config.ts\\n```\\n\\nTo enable Serenity/JS, we need the `support` folder with the `Actors.ts` and the `serenity.config.ts`.\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nTo learn more about folder structure, read about [requirements hierarchy](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/#serenity-bdd-best-practices) in the original Serenity/JS docs.\\nTo learn more about cucumber features, read [this](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/test-runners/cucumber/).\\n\\n:::\\n\\nTo run cucumber, add a `cucumber.js` [configuration file](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/cucumber.js) to your project root. Among other things, we configure to use Serenity/JS Cucumber adapter in here.\\n\\nAdd two new scripts to the `package.json`\\n\\n```json title=\\"package.json\\"\\n\\"scripts\\": {\\n    ...\\n    \\"test:cucumber:execute\\": \\"cucumber-js\\",\\n    \\"test:cucumber\\": \\"failsafe clean serenity-bdd:update test:cucumber:execute test:report\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThere is still one configuration thing left: The `create-next-app` from the last tutorial created a `tsconfig.json` for us. Some compile options are not compatible with cucumber.js, and we have to include the `features` folder.\\n\\n```json title=\\"tsconfig.json\\"\\n{\\n  \\"compilerOptions\\":\\n   {\\n     \\"module\\": \\"commonjs\\",\\n     \\"moduleResolution\\": \\"node\\",\\n     \\"esModuleInterop\\": true,\\n   },\\n   {\\n    \\"include\\": [\\n      \\"features/**/*.ts\\",\\n    ]\\n   }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo not interfere with the original Next.js configuration, I create a copy `tsconfig.next.ts`. I configured the Next.js itself to use this configuration in `next.config.mjs` instead of the `tsconfig.ts` file, just to make sure we still use the right config when building the Next.js app.\\n\\n```js title=\\"next.config.mjs\\"\\n/** @type {import(\'next\').NextConfig} */\\nconst nextConfig = {\\n    typescript: { tsconfigPath: \'tsconfig.next.json\'}\\n};\\n\\nexport default nextConfig;\\n```\\n\\nUntil now, we just did some configuration tweaks. Now we\'re ready to take a look back into our [coffee counter scenario](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/features/coffee-counter/coffee-counter.feature) again. Now have a look into the [counter steps definitions](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/features/step-definitions/counter.steps.ts). Here is where the magic happens. We just reuse the same tasks we [already provided for component testing](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-cucumber-tutorial/blob/main/src/components/CounterSerenity.ts):\\n\\n```ts title=\\"counter.step.ts\\"\\nimport { Given, Then, When } from \'@cucumber/cucumber\';\\nimport { Actor } from \'@serenity-js/core\';\\n\\nimport { CounterSerenity } from \'../../src/components/CounterSerenity\';\\n\\nThen(\'{pronoun} should see that the \\"Increase\\" button is enabled\', async (actor: Actor) =>\\n    actor.attemptsTo(\\n        CounterSerenity.EnsureIncreaseButtonIsEnabled()\\n    ))\\n```\\n\\nYou\'re nearly ready to run the test the first time. Make sure that you start your server with `npm run dev` on port 3000.\\n\\nThen run `npm run test:cucumber` and find the BDD report in the `target/site` folder."},{"id":"ai-requirements-first","metadata":{"permalink":"/ai-requirements-first","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-03-ai-requirements-first.mdx","title":"Testing in the Age of AI - Requirements First","description":"Did you know that many software defects arise from unclear requirements?","date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"testing","permalink":"/tags/testing"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"BDD","permalink":"/tags/bdd"},{"inline":true,"label":"TDD","permalink":"/tags/tdd"}],"readingTime":5.38,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Graefe","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://jangraefe.de","imageURL":"https://www.pilot-period.org/img/jan.jpg","key":"jang","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ai-requirements-first","title":"Testing in the Age of AI - Requirements First","authors":["jang"],"tags":["testing","automation","BDD","TDD"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reuse Component Test Code with BDD Scenarios using Serenity/JS and Playwright","permalink":"/sjs-playwright-ct-cucumber"},"nextItem":{"title":"Component Testing with React/Next.js, Playwright, and Serenity/JS","permalink":"/sjs-playwright-ct"}},"content":"> **Did you know that many software defects arise from unclear requirements?**\\n> **What we\'re seeing today is AI attempting to assist in test creation,**\\n> **promising to increase code coverage. However, this approach often**\\n> **emphasizes testing our implementations rather than testing against**\\n> **our requirements, which I believe has its value but also carries**\\n> **certain risks that must be carefully considered.**\\n\\n## Don\'t test your implementation\\n\\n![AI cannot predict the unknown](/img/ai-requirements-first.jpeg)\\n\\nTo illustrate, let\'s conduct an experiment using our familiar chatbots. I\'ll present a simple function implementation suitable for our demonstration, intentionally flawed.\\n\\n> *This is a TS function. Can you generate me a jest test spec for it?*\\n\\n```ts\\nfunction addTwoNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {\\n    return a / b\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s, what **ChatGPT 3.5** responded:\\n\\n> *Sure, here\'s a Jest test spec for the addTwoNumbers function:*\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { addTwoNumbers } from \'./yourFileName\';\\n\\ndescribe(\'addTwoNumbers\', () => {\\n    it(\'should correctly add two numbers\', () => {\\n        // Arrange\\n        const a = 5;\\n        const b = 3;\\n        \\n        // Act\\n        const result = addTwoNumbers(a, b);\\n\\n        // Assert\\n        expect(result).toEqual(8);\\n    });\\n\\n    it(\'should handle negative numbers correctly\', () => {\\n        // Arrange\\n        const a = -10;\\n        const b = 7;\\n\\n        // Act\\n        const result = addTwoNumbers(a, b);\\n\\n        // Assert\\n        expect(result).toEqual(-3);\\n    });\\n\\n    it(\'should handle zero correctly\', () => {\\n        // Arrange\\n        const a = 0;\\n        const b = 5;\\n\\n        // Act\\n        const result = addTwoNumbers(a, b);\\n\\n        // Assert\\n        expect(result).toEqual(0);\\n    });\\n\\n    // Add more test cases as needed\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe generated tests do not account for my implementation; they assume I want to add numbers as the function title suggests. The test will fail. However, this allows me to challenge my code.\\n\\nHere\'s, what **Gemini 1.0** answered:\\n\\n> *I\'d be glad to provide a Jest test spec for the addTwoNumbers function, incorporating the valuable insights from the ratings and addressing the identified issues:*\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { addTwoNumbers } from \'./path/to/your/function\'; // Replace with the actual path\\n\\ndescribe(\'addTwoNumbers\', () => {\\n  // Test case 1: Basic addition with positive numbers\\n  it(\'should add two positive numbers correctly\', () => {\\n    expect(addTwoNumbers(5, 3)).toBe(5 / 3); // Corrected the expected result\\n  });\\n\\n  // Test case 2: Addition with negative numbers\\n  it(\'should handle addition with negative numbers\', () => {\\n    expect(addTwoNumbers(-2, 4)).toBe(-2 / 4); // Corrected the expected result\\n  });\\n\\n  // Test case 3: Division by zero (error handling)\\n  it(\'should throw an error when dividing by zero\', () => {\\n    expect(() => addTwoNumbers(5, 0)).toThrowError(\'Division by zero\'); // Handle division by zero appropriately\\n  });\\n\\n  // Test case 4: Data type validation (optional)\\n  it(\'should only accept numbers as arguments (optional)\', () => {\\n    expect(() => addTwoNumbers(\'five\', 3)).toThrowError(\\n      \'addTwoNumbers: Arguments must be numbers\' // Customized error message\\n    );\\n\\n    expect(() => addTwoNumbers(5, \'three\')).toThrowError(\\n      \'addTwoNumbers: Arguments must be numbers\' // Customized error message\\n    );\\n  });\\n});\\n```\\n\\nGemini generated tests that pass. The test reads like an addition is tested, but effectively, it\'s the division.\\n\\nTo be fair, sometimes the bots detect inconsistencies between the function name and implementation.\\n\\nHowever, we miss the point here: \\n\\n**What\'s unknown is if our customer was requiring an addition or a division.**\\n\\nEither the function implementation is incorrect and should be `a + b`, \\nor there\'s a naming issue, and it should be named `divideTwoNumbers()`.\\n\\nSo, what are the takeaways?\\n\\n**1. Testing should align with requirements and expected behavior**\\n\\nThis is crucial to ensure that code functions as intended and potential issues are identified.\\n\\n**2. Importance of human judgment**\\n\\nIt\'s essential for humans to analyze the information provided by large language models and make informed decisions based on context and domain knowledge.\\n\\n## Align your tests with your requirements\\n\\nWhile I don\'t want to leave you without a solution to this problem,\\nit\'s worth noting that you should utilize AI to assist in testing.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s important to focus on explaining the purpose of the test\\nand the problem you want to solve, rather than just testing the \\nmplementation itself.\\n\\nWhile this principle is not new, it\'s crucial to remember,\\nas it\'s something that can be overlooked when rushing into the use of AI.\\n\\n\\n>*Can you write me a jest test spec that test test a typescript function that takes two numbers and divide them. Please cover edge cases.*\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { divideNumbers } from \'./yourDivideFunction\'; // Import your divide function\\n\\ndescribe(\'divideNumbers function\', () => {\\n  it(\'should divide two positive numbers correctly\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(10, 2)).toBe(5);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should divide a positive number by zero and return Infinity\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(10, 0)).toBe(Infinity);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should divide a negative number by a positive number correctly\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(-10, 2)).toBe(-5);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should divide zero by a positive number and return 0\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(0, 10)).toBe(0);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should return NaN if divided by zero\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(0, 0)).toBe(NaN);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should divide a large number by a small number correctly\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(1000000, 0.000001)).toBe(1e+12);\\n  });\\n\\n  it(\'should handle decimal precision properly\', () => {\\n    expect(divideNumbers(1, 3)).toBeCloseTo(0.333, 3); // Rounded to 3 decimal places\\n  });\\n\\n  // Add more test cases as needed for your specific requirements\\n});\\n```\\n\\nWith the right input, you can even get out BDD scenarios in Gherkin:\\n\\n```\\nFeature: Division of Two Numbers\\n  As a user\\n  I want to divide two numbers\\n  So that I can perform mathematical operations accurately\\n\\n  Scenario Outline: Divide two numbers\\n    Given I have two numbers <numerator> and <denominator>\\n    When I divide <numerator> by <denominator>\\n    Then the result should be <result>\\n\\n    Examples:\\n      | numerator | denominator | result |\\n      | 6         | 3           | 2      |\\n      | 10        | 2           | 5      |\\n      | 0         | 5           | 0      |\\n      | 8         | 4           | 2      |\\n      | 15        | 5           | 3      |\\n\\n  Scenario: Divide by zero\\n    Given I have a number\\n    When I try to divide the number by zero\\n    Then the operation should fail with an error message\\n\\n  Scenario Outline: Divide by a number close to zero\\n    Given I have a number <numerator>\\n    And I have a very small positive number <denominator>\\n    When I divide <numerator> by <denominator>\\n    Then the result should be positive infinity\\n\\n    Examples:\\n      | numerator | denominator |\\n      | 10        | 0.0001      |\\n      | 100       | 0.00001     |\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile AI-generated tests can be a great tool for initial test coverage or catching basic errors, relying solely on them can lead us down the wrong path if we\'re not careful.  The true power lies in combining AI\'s capabilities with human expertise.  By guiding AI with clear requirements and leveraging its strengths in areas like data analysis and automation, we can create a more efficient and effective testing process.\\n\\n:::note[Disclaimer]\\nThis blog post focuses on the limitations of AI-generated tests for a specific example involving a simple mathematical function. The potential benefits and limitations of AI testing in more complex scenarios are vast and warrant further exploration. Additionally, it\'s important to acknowledge the potential for biases inherent in the training data used for AI models, which can impact the results generated.\\n:::"},{"id":"sjs-playwright-ct","metadata":{"permalink":"/sjs-playwright-ct","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-25-sjs-playwright-ct.mdx","title":"Component Testing with React/Next.js, Playwright, and Serenity/JS","description":"*Continuing my series about Serenity/JS:","date":"2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"testing","permalink":"/tags/testing"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"serenity-js","permalink":"/tags/serenity-js"},{"inline":true,"label":"hands-on","permalink":"/tags/hands-on"},{"inline":true,"label":"BDD","permalink":"/tags/bdd"}],"readingTime":8.23,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Graefe","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://jangraefe.de","imageURL":"https://www.pilot-period.org/img/jan.jpg","key":"jang","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"sjs-playwright-ct","title":"Component Testing with React/Next.js, Playwright, and Serenity/JS","authors":["jang"],"tags":["testing","automation","serenity-js","hands-on","BDD"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Testing in the Age of AI - Requirements First","permalink":"/ai-requirements-first"},"nextItem":{"title":"Concrete Examples - Key to Software Collaboration","permalink":"/concrete-examples"}},"content":">***Continuing my series about Serenity/JS:\\nDive into the potent pairing of Serenity/JS and Playwright.\\nWitness how this winning combination revolutionizes component testing.\\nReady to elevate your testing game?***\\n\\nPlaywright introduces an \\n[experimental component testing approach](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components).\\nIn this tutorial, we\'ll explore how to seamlessly integrate component testing into a \\nReact/Next.js application using Playwright in conjunction with \\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/), a powerful testing framework.\\n\\n![Serenity/JS](/img/serenity-js-social-card.jpg)\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to set up and execute tests from scratch.\\nHowever, if you prefer to skip these steps, you can access the complete example code in\\n[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/viper3400/next-sjs-ct-tutorial).\\n:::\\n\\n## Setting Up an Example Application\\n\\nBefore diving into testing, let\'s establish a baseline React application.\\nFollowing the [recommended guidelines](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project),\\nwe\'ll leverage [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as our framework of choice.\\n\\nWe\'ll initialize a Next.js application in\\n[non-interactive mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app#non-interactive),\\nincorporating TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.\\n\\n```sh\\nnpx create-next-app@latest next-sjs-ct-tutorial --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias \\"@/*\\"\\ncd next-sjs-ct-tutorial\\nnpm run dev[def]\\n```\\n\\nOnce completed, your newly created Next.js application will be\\naccessible at http://localhost:3000/.\\n\\n:::info[Mind the Node.js version]\\nEnsure that you\'ve installed at least Node.js version 18.17.0 for Next.js,\\nthe minimum required version by the time of writing.\\nYou can manage Node.js versions using tools like [Volta](https://volta.sh/).\\nFor example, pinning the Node.js version to the latest available, currently 20.11.1,\\ncan be achieved with:\\n\\n```sh\\nvolta pin node@latest\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\"Pinned Node.js version using Volta\\"\\n```\\n:::\\n\\nNow, let\'s enhance our basic page by creating a small application with the following\\nuser story:\\n\\n:::note[User Story]\\nAs a user, I want to interact with a counter component that displays a count value and allows me to increase or decrease it within a specified range.\\nThe component should feature two buttons: \\"Increase\\" and \\"Decrease.\\"\\n\\nWhen I click the \\"Increase\\" button, the displayed count value should increment, providing immediate visual feedback. Conversely, clicking the \\"Decrease\\" button should decrement the count value. However, these actions should be constrained within a defined range, preventing the count from exceeding a maximum of 10 and a minimum value of 0.\\n\\nTo ensure intuitive interaction, the buttons should visually indicate when they are disabled, preventing further increment or decrement operations beyond the defined range.

But here\'s the spoiler: there\'s no magical tool to solve it \u2014 just the power of collaboration. Get ready for a paradigm shift towards cohesive teamwork!***\\n\\nEffective collaboration among Developers, Testers, and Product Owners (POs) in software development is crucial for success. However, one common hurdle in this collaboration is the struggle to find concrete examples to guide development and testing.\\nOvercoming this challenge requires **patience**, **training**, and a **team-driven approach**\\n, without imposing strict directives.\\n\\n![samples from interior desing](/img/interior-design-1508276_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [martynaszulist](https://pixabay.com/users/martynaszulist-1055898/)_\\n\\n**The Reasons Behind the Struggle**\\n\\nFirst and foremost it\'s important to understand the reasons behind this struggle. Here are some of them:\\n\\n1. **Unclear Requirements**: Incomplete or vague requirements lead to confusion and differing interpretations, making it hard to articulate clear examples.\\n\\n2. **Communication Barriers**: Technical differences, language nuances, or cultural diversity can hinder clear communication, causing misunderstandings in example definition.\\n\\n3. **Differing Perspectives**: Each stakeholder brings unique viewpoints, sometimes leading to discordance and difficulty in agreeing on examples.\\n\\n4. **Assumptions and Implicit Knowledge**: Unspoken assumptions can obscure clarity and perpetuate misunderstandings.\\n\\n5. **Complexity of Features**: Some features are inherently complex, making it challenging to cover all scenarios with concise examples.\\n\\n6. **Time Constraints**: Pressures to deliver quickly can limit thorough discussion and exploration of examples.\\n\\n7. **Inadequate Documentation**: Poorly documented or outdated examples add to confusion and inconsistency.\\n\\n**Steps to Overcome the Struggle**\\n\\n1. **Clarify Requirements Collaboratively**: Hold regular refinement sessions where team members openly discuss and clarify requirements, fostering an environment where everyone\'s input is valued.\\n\\n2. **Use Techniques for Requirement Elicitation**: Employ methods like user story mapping and behavior-driven development to uncover hidden requirements and ensure alignment with user needs.\\n\\n3. **Document and Maintain Examples**: Establish a shared repository for documenting examples, ensuring accessibility and encouraging everyone to contribute and maintain it for consistency.\\n\\nBy taking these steps, teams can enhance collaboration, improve communication, and overcome the challenge of finding examples effectively in software development.\\n\\n**The Fear of Incomplete Examples**\\n\\nWhile collaboration is key, it\'s important to acknowledge the hesitancy some stakeholders\\nmay have in providing examples. They sometimes fear that the examples they give might not fully\\ncapture the complexities of the final solution.\\n\\nThey understand that an example is just that \u2014 an example \u2014 and worry that it may not\\nencompass every aspect of the desired outcome. \\nHowever, it\'s essential to emphasize to stakeholders that starting with simple, \\nstraightforward examples is a crucial first step. \\n\\nThese initial examples lay the foundation upon which more complex scenarios can be built\\nin subsequent iterations. By understanding that examples are iterative and can evolve over\\ntime, stakeholdes can feel more confident in contributing to the collaborative process.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nThe ability to define concrete examples is a cornerstone of effective collaboration.\\nBy acknowledging the hurdles and embracing the power of teamwork, teams can transcend\\nlanguage barriers and navigate through the complexities of requirements with confidence.\\nThrough iterative refinement, stakeholders can contribute valuable insights,\\nensuring that examples evolve to accurately reflect the desired outcomes.\\n\\nSo, while there may not be a magical tool to solve the challenge of defining examples,\\nthe collective efforts of dedicated teams pave the way for innovation, efficiency,\\nand ultimately, the delivery of exceptional software solutions."},{"id":"serenityjs-protractor2playwright","metadata":{"permalink":"/serenityjs-protractor2playwright","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-04-sjs-protractor2playwright.mdx","title":"Serenity/JS - Migrate from Protractor to Playwright","description":"*When I chose Serenity/JS as a vendor-agnostic API, my intention was to isolate my test specification from the test runner.","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"testing","permalink":"/tags/testing"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"serenity-js","permalink":"/tags/serenity-js"},{"inline":true,"label":"hands-on","permalink":"/tags/hands-on"}],"readingTime":4.69,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Graefe","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://jangraefe.de","imageURL":"https://www.pilot-period.org/img/jan.jpg","key":"jang","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"serenityjs-protractor2playwright","title":"Serenity/JS - Migrate from Protractor to Playwright","authors":["jang"],"tags":["testing","automation","serenity-js","hands-on"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Concrete Examples - Key to Software Collaboration","permalink":"/concrete-examples"},"nextItem":{"title":"HTML Tables in Browser Automation Using Serenity/JS and Playwright","permalink":"/serenityjs-tables-peql"}},"content":">***When I chose Serenity/JS as a vendor-agnostic API, my intention was to isolate my test specification from the test runner.\\nToday, I seamlessly transitioned from Protractor to Playwright in less than 10 minutes. \\nThe kicker?

Empower your web automation journey with Serenity/JS \u2013 where simplicity meets precision!***\\n## Automating HTML Tables with Serenity/JS\\n\\nIf you\'re dealing with web automation and HTML tables, \\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) provides a powerful and expressive way to interact with page elements. \\n\\nTraditional HTML selectors, such as those\\nbased on CSS or XPath, are often hierarchical. \\nHowever, tables are conceptually two-dimensional, \\nwith rows and columns, making it less straightforward \\nto express certain queries using these selectors.\\n\\n![Serentiy/JS](/img/serenity-js-social-card.jpg)\\n\\nIn this article, we\'ll explore the usage of the \\n[Page Element Query Language (PEQL)](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/)\\nin Serenity/JS for automating HTML tables, focusing on \\n- scenarios where you know the index of the row you want to access and \\n- situations where you need to locate a row based on its content.\\n\\n:::tip\\nExamples on this page where tested with Serenity/JS version 3.15.0.\\nTo get started with Serenity/JS and Playwright have a look into the\\n[Serenity/JS Playwright project template](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-playwright-test-template).\\n\\n[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org/) is a modular and extensible abstraction layer that works seamlessly \\nwith integration tools like Playwright, Selenium, WebdriverIO, Appium, or Axios, \\nand gives you a consistent, intuitive, and vendor-agnostic API to work with.\\nIt integrates with popular test runners like Cucumber, Jasmine, Mocha, and Playwright Test.\\n\\nHave a look into the other [Serenity/JS project templates](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/getting-started/project-templates/) as well.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Knowing the Index of the Row\\n\\n![Example Table](/img/Example-Table.png)\\n\\nConsider a scenario where you have a simple table, like [this one from w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp), and you know the index of the row you want to access.\\n\\n```html\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n    <th>Company</th>\\n    <th>Contact</th>\\n    <th>Country</th>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>\\n    <td>Maria Anders</td>\\n    <td>Germany</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>\\n    <td>Francisco Chang</td>\\n    <td>Mexico</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Ernst Handel</td>\\n    <td>Roland Mendel</td>\\n    <td>Austria</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Island Trading</td>\\n    <td>Helen Bennett</td>\\n    <td>UK</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Laughing Bacchus Winecellars</td>\\n    <td>Yoshi Tannamuri</td>\\n    <td>Canada</td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti</td>\\n    <td>Giovanni Rovelli</td>\\n    <td>Italy</td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n```\\n\\n The following example demonstrates how to use Serenity/JS to interact with the table:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Ensure, equals } from \'@serenity-js/assertions\';\\nimport { describe, it } from \'@serenity-js/playwright-test\';\\nimport { By, Navigate, PageElements, Text } from \'@serenity-js/web\';\\n\\nconst CustomersTable = () => PageElement.located(By.css(\'#customers\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'customer table\')\\n\\nconst TableRows = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'tr\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table rows\').of(CustomersTable());\\n\\nconst TableColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table columns\')\\n    .of(CustomersTable())\\n\\nconst TableColumnsInRow = (index: number) => \\n    TableColumns().of(TableRows().nth(index));\\n\\nconst CompanyInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(0)\\n    .describedAs(`company column in row ${index}`);\\n\\nconst ContactInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(1)\\n    .describedAs(`contact column in row ${index}`);\\n\\nconst CountryInRow = (index: number) => TableColumnsInRow(index).nth(2)\\n    .describedAs(`country column in row ${index}`);\\n\\ndescribe(\'table selector\', () => (\\n    it(\'ensures text of columns in a row\', async ({actor}) => (\\n        actor.attemptsTo(\\n            Navigate.to(\'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(CompanyInRow(1)), equals(\'Alfreds Futterkiste\')),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(ContactInRow(1)), equals(\'Maria Anders\')),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(CountryInRow(1)), equals(\'Germany\'))\\n        ))\\n    )\\n));\\n```\\nThe output in the Serenity/JS report will look like follows:\\n\\n```\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of company column in row 1 does equal \'Alfreds Futterkiste\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of contact column in row 1 does equal \'Maria Anders\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of country column in row 1 does equal \'Germany\'\\n```\\n## Unknown Row Index: Locating Rows by Content\\n\\nIn some scenarios, the table\'s sort order might not be defined, and the index of the row under test may vary. In such cases, you can locate a row based on expected content. Let\'s say we want to ensure that the contact name for \\"Centro comercial Moctezuma\\" in Mexico equals \\"Francisco Chang.\\" Here\'s how you can achieve this with Serenity/JS:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { contain, Ensure, equals } from \'@serenity-js/assertions\';\\nimport { describe, it } from \'@serenity-js/playwright-test\';\\nimport { By, Navigate, PageElement, PageElements, Text } from \'@serenity-js/web\';\\n\\nconst CustomersTable = () => PageElement.located(By.css(\'#customers\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'customer table\')\\n\\nconst TableRows = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'tr\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'all table rows\').of(CustomersTable());\\n\\nconst CompanyColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(1)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'company columns\');\\n\\nconst ContactColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(2)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'contact columns\');\\n\\nconst CountryColumns = () => PageElements.located(By.css(\'td:nth-child(3)\'))\\n    .describedAs(\'country columns\');\\n\\nconst ContactColumByCountryAndCompany = (country: string, company: string) => \\n    ContactColumns().of(\\n        TableRows()\\n            .where(Text.ofAll(CountryColumns()), contain(country))\\n            .where(Text.ofAll(CompanyColumns()), contain(company))\\n            .first())\\n        .first();\\n\\ndescribe(\'table selector\', () => (\\n    it(\'ensures text of columns in a row\', async ({actor}) => (\\n        actor.attemptsTo(\\n            Navigate.to(\'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'),\\n            Ensure.that(Text.of(ContactColumByCountryAndCompany(\\n                \'Mexico\',\'Centro comercial Moctezuma\')),\\n            equals(\'Francisco Chang\'))\\n        ))\\n    )\\n));\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we introduce new `PageElements` such as `CompanyColumn`, `ContactColumn`, and `CountryColumn` to represent individual columns. The `ContactColumByCountryAndCompany` function is used to locate the contact column by matching the country and company. We utilize the `where` method to filter rows based on the content of the country and company columns and then take the first result.\\n\\nThe report remains readable domain specific language:\\n\\n```\\n\u2713 Alice navigates to \'https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp\'\\n\u2713 Alice ensures that the text of the first of contact columns \\n    of the first of all table rows of customer table where the \\n    text of country columns does contain \'Mexico\' and the text \\n    of company columns does contain \'Centro comercial Moctezuma\' \\n    does equal \'Francisco Chang\'\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that in this use case, we assume there is only one result for the given combination of country and company. Therefore, we always take the first result to ensure consistency.\\n\\nBy using Serenity/JS and the [Page Element Query Language (PEQL)](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/web-testing/page-element-query-language/), you can create expressive and maintainable test scripts for HTML table automation. These examples showcase how to handle scenarios where you know the row index and when you need to locate rows based on their content, providing a flexible and powerful solution for web automation."},{"id":"skills_before_role","metadata":{"permalink":"/skills_before_role","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-21-skills_before_role.mdx","title":"The Role of Testers in Cross-Functional Teams","description":"Are cross-functional teams missing out on excellence by expecting everyone to be a master of everything?

Challenge the misconception, embrace testers\' specialized skills, and discover how prioritizing individual strengths over rigid roles sparks innovation in software development.***\\n\\n**Embracing Diversity in Skillsets: The Role of Testers in Cross-Functional Teams**\\n\\nIn the evolving landscape of software development, the discourse often revolves around the structure of teams and the significance of individual roles. However, it\'s crucial to move beyond fixed roles and recognize the diverse skills and abilities each team member brings to the table. One area that deserves attention in this discussion is the role of testers within cross-functional teams.\\n\\n![business man holding mask](/img/mask-3829017_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n**Breaking the Mold: Testers in Cross-Functional Teams**\\n\\nTraditionally, there has been a debate about whether dedicated testers are necessary in agile and cross-functional teams. Some argue that every team member should be adept at testing, blurring the lines between roles. However, a more nuanced perspective acknowledges the unique expertise that testers bring to the development process.\\n\\n**Complementary Strengths: The Tester\'s Contribution**\\n\\nIn a comprehensive approach to team dynamics, the focus is on building teams with a mix of skills tailored to specific goals. Testers, with their specialized knowledge in quality assurance and testing methodologies, play a crucial role in ensuring the robustness of the software. Their ability to identify and address potential issues adds a layer of quality that may be challenging for a non-specialist to replicate.\\n\\n**Dispelling Misunderstandings: Testing as a Specialized Skill**\\n\\nOne common misunderstanding within discussions about cross-functional teams is the belief that every team member needs to be equally skilled in every aspect of software development. This misconception can lead to inflexible views on how teams work and hinder their potential. Acknowledging testing as a specialized skill dispels the notion that all team members need to be testing experts. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of collaboration, where testers and developers work together to achieve a balance between speed and quality.\\n\\n**People-Centric Collaboration: Recognizing Individual Competencies**\\n\\nShifting the conversation from rigid roles to celebrating individuals and their capabilities is particularly relevant when discussing testers. By recognizing the unique skills that testers bring, teams can foster a collaborative culture where the focus is on complementing strengths rather than conforming to a one-size-fits-all approach.\\n\\n**Fostering Innovation: The Tester\'s Role in Building Quality Software**\\n\\nIn the pursuit of innovation, having a dedicated focus on quality is paramount. Testers contribute to this by conducting thorough testing, identifying potential risks, and ensuring that the software meets the highest standards. Embracing a mix of skills, including the specialized expertise of testers, allows teams to create innovative solutions without compromising on quality.\\n\\n**Conclusion: Celebrating Diversity for Collaborative Success**\\n\\nIn the ever-changing landscape of software development, the emphasis should be on recognizing and celebrating the diverse skills within cross-functional teams. Testers, with their unique expertise, play a vital role in enhancing the overall quality of the software. By dispelling the misunderstanding that cross-functional teams must have equal expertise in every area, teams can foster a culture that values individual competencies, truly embracing the richness that a diverse mix of skills brings to collaborative efforts. It\'s time to appreciate the integral role of testers and move towards a more inclusive and effective approach to cross-functional team dynamics."},{"id":"customer-know-best","metadata":{"permalink":"/customer-know-best","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-14-customer-knows-best.mdx","title":"Does Customer Knows Best?","description":"Unlock the true potential of your ongoing software projects by embracing the richness of customer diversity.

In reality, customers often constitute a diverse group with varying goals, perspectives, and priorities. This diversity poses a significant challenge in transforming their input into concrete requirements.\\n\\n*Action Point 1: Acknowledging Diversity*\\n- Recognize and appreciate the diversity within the customer group.\\n- Understand that each stakeholder brings a unique set of goals, expectations, and constraints to the table.\\n\\n*Action Point 2: Stakeholder Mapping*\\n- Develop a comprehensive stakeholder map, identifying different departments, roles, and levels within the organization.\\n- Use this map to visualize and understand the diverse perspectives that need to be reconciled during the requirements engineering process.\\n\\n**Goals vs. Requirements**\\n\\nWhile the adage \\"customer knows best\\" emphasizes the importance of customer input in requirements engineering, it\'s crucial to discern between high-level goals and concrete requirements. Customers often express overarching aspirations like \\"increase efficiency\\" or \\"improve user satisfaction.\\" However, these aspirations lack the specificity required for effective software development.\\n\\nA common challenge arises when customers, in an attempt to articulate their goals, inadvertently propose requirements that may not effectively fulfill those aspirations. This gap underscores the need for guidance in translating broad goals into tangible, actionable requirements.\\n\\n_Action Point 3: Goal-to-Requirement Translation_\\n\\n- Establish a structured process for translating overarching goals into specific and measurable requirements.\\n- Engage in collaborative workshops with stakeholders to distill broad goals into requirements that directly contribute to achieving those goals.\\n\\n_Action Point 4: Customer Guidance on Requirement Formulation_\\n\\n- Facilitate open communication with customers to ensure a clear understanding of their goals and expectations.\\n- Provide guidance to customers in formulating requirements that align with and effectively contribute to achieving their stated goals.\\n\\nBy differentiating between goals and requirements and offering guidance in the translation process, the development team can ensure that the final set of requirements not only captures customer aspirations accurately but also lays the groundwork for a successful and goal-oriented software development process.\\n\\n**Conflicting Goals and Priorities**\\n\\nThe existence of conflicting goals and priorities within the customer group further complicates the process. Different departments may have divergent objectives, and individual stakeholders may prioritize features differently based on their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\n*Action Point 5: Open Communication and Negotiation*\\n- Foster an environment of open communication between development teams and customers.\\n- Initiate regular check-ins and feedback sessions to identify and address conflicting goals and priorities.\\n- Establish a framework for negotiation and compromise that aligns with the overarching project objectives.\\n\\n**The Importance of Collaboration**\\n\\nTo overcome the challenges posed by the diversity of customer perspectives, effective collaboration between development teams and customers is paramount.\\n\\n*Action Point 6: Collaborative Techniques*\\n- Utilize collaborative techniques such as workshops, interviews, and prototyping to facilitate a shared understanding of requirements.\\n- Ensure that all stakeholders have a platform to voice their concerns and actively participate in the requirements engineering process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the customer\'s input remains invaluable in the requirements engineering process, it is crucial to move beyond the simplistic notion that \\"customer knows best.\\" By acknowledging diversity, translating goals into requirements, addressing conflicting priorities, and fostering collaboration, development teams can navigate the complexities inherent in customer knowledge within the ongoing context of their projects.\\n\\n**Reading Recommendation**\\n\\n - \\"Discovering Requirements: How to Specify Products and Services\\", book by Ian F.

The inevitable dawn of quality issues prompts a concerted effort to address testing challenges in a complex setup. However, in the urgency to salvage the project, the critical aspect of thorough and qualitative planning, with the objective of \\"building quality in,\\" often takes a back seat.\\n\\nWhen faced with unexpected quality issues in a complex setup involving \\n- multiple development teams, \\n- customizers, and\\n- a diverse customer base,\\n\\norganizations are compelled to navigate through coordinated testing challenges.\\n\\n![a team solving a puzzle](/img/integration-1777536_1280.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n## The Pitfalls of Testing Dynamics\\n\\n**Lack of Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nIn complex setups, there is often an overarching sense of \\"quality,\\" but primarily from a strategic perspective. The challenge arises from a lack of a unified test concept, as each team operates with its own testers under the charge of team leads, without a detailed test strategy covering the entirety of the software.\\n\\n**Missing \\"One Team\\" Sense in Testing**\\n\\nThe decentralized nature of testing across various teams and customizers contributes to a challenge in fostering a \\"one team\\" sense in testing. Each team may have its own quality assurance focus, leading to potential blind spots and overlooking critical interactions between components.\\n\\n**Coordinating Test Efforts**\\n\\nThe coordination of testing efforts becomes a challenge when decentralized teams operate with varied testing approaches. This dynamic makes it more difficult to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive testing strategy that spans the entire software architecture.\\n\\n**Insufficient Cross-Team Communication**\\n\\nThe absence of a unified test concept often translates into challenges related to cross-team communication. This siloed approach hampers the identification and resolution of cross-functional issues that can significantly impact the end-user experience.\\n\\n## The Tester\'s Voice: Fostering Consolidated Testing Insights\\n\\nTo address the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups, it is crucial to elevate the voice of testers from all teams. Their insights and perspectives should be not only valued but celebrated, as they contribute to the creation of a powerful and consolidated image of the software\'s testing needs.\\n\\n**A Collaborative Approach**\\n\\nRather than relying on top-down decisions, embrace a collaborative approach where the voices of individual testers are heard, fostering a stronger sense of identification with the testing process. This not only enhances the quality of testing strategies but also empowers teams to take charge of their testing journey.\\n\\n**The Importance of Listening**\\n\\nListening to testers from diverse teams is not just about hearing their opinions; it\'s about acknowledging their unique insights and experiences. This approach empowers testers to shape the testing process, enriching it by uncovering potential blind spots and ensuring that the entire software architecture is thoroughly examined.\\n\\n## Empowering Teams\\n\\nEmpower teams with the autonomy to _shape_ their testing strategies. This not only builds a more resilient and effective testing framework but also instills a sense of ownership. When team members actively contribute to the planning and execution of testing efforts, their identification with the process becomes a powerful force.\\n\\n**A Holistic Approach Across Complex Setups**\\n\\nIn complex setups involving multiple development teams, customizers, and a diverse customer base, the \\"build quality in\\" approach should transcend individual responsibilities. Quality assurance should not be the sole responsibility of specific teams; instead, it should be an overarching principle embraced by every stakeholder in the process.\\n\\n**Building Quality In: A Collective Empowerment**\\n\\nRecognizing that quality cannot be tested into a product only after development but must be an intrinsic part of the entire chain is pivotal. Each development team, customizer, and customer plays a crucial role in this collective empowerment to build quality into the software from the ground up.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Quality Assurance Starts with Unified Planning and Empowerment\\nWhile the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups may be intricate, it is imperative to recognize that the aftermath of quality issues demands more than a rushed search for test resources. The true solution lies in fostering a culture of qualitative planning, a collective commitment to building quality in, and an empowering environment where every tester\'s voice is not only heard but celebrated. This proactive approach not only mitigates risks but also lays the foundation for delivering software that stands the test of time.\\n\\n## Concrete Steps to Forge Unified Testing Success in Complex Environments\\n\\nHere\'s a short action list on how to overcome the challenges of coordinated testing in complex setups and empower testing excellence:\\n\\n**1. Establish a Unified Test Concept**\\n\\nDevelop a comprehensive test concept that spans the entire software architecture. Ensure that every team, including customizers and stakeholders, contributes to and aligns with this unified vision for testing.\\n\\n**2.

Imagine this: instead of really digging into the software, a tester just goes through a set list of tests, checking boxes as they go. It might look like progress, but it\'s like scratching the surface without getting to the real stuff.\\n\\n![human finger touches robot finger](/img/tester-vs-bot.jpg)\\n_Image by [geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt-9301/)_\\n\\n**The Ritual**\\n\\nPicture this as a ritual: a tester follows a set path, just ticking off boxes with specific inputs and expected results. It\'s like a dance, but instead of exploring the software\'s ins and outs, it\'s more like going through the motions.\\n\\n**The Misleading Idea**\\n\\nLet\'s clear something up: just ticking boxes doesn\'t equal effective testing. It might seem like things are getting done, but it doesn\'t go deep enough to find the hidden problems in the code.\\n\\n**Going Beyond**\\n\\nSoftware testing is an art. It\'s not just about following a script; it\'s about actively thinking and engaging with the software. Real testers don\'t stick to the script \u2013 they go off the beaten path, checking every corner for potential issues.\\n\\n**More Than Just Checking Boxes**\\n\\nGood testers don\'t rely only on checkboxes in a test execution plan. They bring in critical thinking, creativity, and a deep understanding of how the software works. Thorough testing means crafting tests that go beyond the obvious, thinking ahead, and making sure every part of the software gets a good look.\\n\\n**The Danger of Robotic Testing**\\n\\nWhen testing becomes mindless checkbox ticking, it\'s like being stuck in robot mode. The line between a real tester and an automated bot starts to blur. The human touch \u2013 the ability to adapt, think creatively, and find tricky issues \u2013 disappears.\\n\\n**Conclusion: Embracing  The Quality Journey**\\n\\nIn software testing, it\'s not just about getting through a checklist. It\'s a journey, a quest to really understand what makes the software tick. Let\'s move past the routine and embrace the heart of testing \u2013 an ever-evolving process that separates the real testers from the software bots.\\n\\n:::danger The Role of Regression Tests\\n\\nWhile advocating for a holistic approach and  the importance of moving beyond checkbox testing to truly understand and engage with software, it is crucial to acknowledge the value of reliable regression tests.\\n\\n**It is the combination of thoughtful, exploratory testing and robust regression testing that forms the backbone of a comprehensive quality assurance strategy.**   \\n\\nStriking this balance ensures not only the uncovering of new issues but also the preservation of the stability and reliability of the software over time. \\n\\nBe aware to recognize the moment to introduce automation into your testing strategy as a key consideration for maintaining an effective and efficient software testing process.\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"how","metadata":{"permalink":"/how","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-01-how-i-became-a-tester.md","title":"How to become a software tester","description":"About how to become a software tester","date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"SoftwareTesting","permalink":"/tags/software-testing"},{"inline":true,"label":"QualityAssurance","permalink":"/tags/quality-assurance"}],"readingTime":2.6,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Graefe","title":"Maintainer","url":"https://jangraefe.de","imageURL":"https://www.pilot-period.org/img/jan.jpg","key":"jang","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how","title":"How to become a software tester","authors":["jang"],"tags":["SoftwareTesting","QualityAssurance"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Feel the Heartbeat of Software Testing","permalink":"/tester-vs-bot"}},"content":"## About how to become a software tester\\n\\nWell, you can google this and get a lot of valid answers.\\n\\nSo, this is the story, about **I** became a software tester.\\n\\nAfter successfully graduating from technical college about 15+ years ago, I was hired by a small software development company. It was specialized in software for a small market in the broadcasting sector. The software was very modular, highly configurable and rich in interfaces - either to our own modules or to third party vendors.\\n\\nMy job was to install, configure and take the software into production at the customer\'s site (within the scope of implementation projects). Furthermore, I provided remote support from the office. If errors occurred during operation, I was the first point of contact for the customer. \\n\\nAt this time there was no tester or test process in my team. Nor was there a clearly defined release process. The developers tested themselves, sent debug versions (all in one *.exe files) via email to the customer. The customer then tried it out and put the version into operation.\\n\\nThis was my first contact with a mantra, which is still with me today:\\n\\n> **\\"The customer tests himself. He knows best. He knows how it should work\\".** \\n\\nWhen I sat back in the support office in front of our web portal, I somehow got a different impression. If the customer knew how it had to work, why would he put a version into operation that caused errors after a more or even less long period being in production?\\n\\nAnd why were the customers so angry,  complaining about bad quality? After all, they had tested it themselves. With their own business processes. And found it to be suitable? Otherwise they wouldn\'t have put the version into production, right?\\n\\nI agree, the difference between \\"testing\\" and \\"trying something out\\" needs a separate post...\\n\\nIn any case, I was tired of constantly vowing better quality next time to customers. I\'m sure our customers were also tired of believing me.\\n\\nSo, this small software development team had also heard something about the concept of having independent software testing. Having tests done by a second instance (besides the developer himself) before release the software to the customer.\\n\\nI found the topic exciting. After all, it would enable me to gain even more better knowledge how the software works. I would also be more competent in answering questions when supporting. We would find errors earlier. We would better understand the customer\'s business processes. All in all, deliver better quality.\\n\\nSo that\'s how my career as a software tester started. An exciting job with a lot of build-up work and a steep learning curve. \\n\\nPS:\\n\\nTesting in a team with 5 - 6 developers is not a part-time job. And I still had the other tasks, that time. When customer start to order more projects again, I realized that the focus would be shifted.  I would have even less time for what had become the job I wanted to do in future. So I decided to say goodbye and work as a software tester from now on."}]}}')}}]);
