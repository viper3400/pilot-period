It is indicative of this \\nthat it is often about the technical aspects of a framework or tool. \\nThe more heated the discussion, the more the aspect of testing slips into the background. \\nLet\'s take a buzzword and take it apart: **Test automation**. \\nThis word consists of the Share **Test** and **Automation**. \\nLet\'s take a look at an example. We have a number of d\u2202irectories. \\nWe look for files in these directories. \\nIs a file older than 60 days, we delete them. The code in an automation script might look like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nvar folders = [ \'pictures\', \'documents\', \'desktop\' ];\\n\\nforeach(folder in folders) {\\n    var files = folder.getFiles();\\n    foreach (file in files) {\\n        var fileAge = file.getAge();\\n        if (fileAge > Days(60))\\n          delete(file)\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo we have automated the deletion of old files. But have we **tested** that the files have been deleted? Let\'s move on to **Browser Automation**. Here, too, we have a Automation job: Open a search engine and find how to needs to boil an egg.\\n\\n```ts\\nvar webpage = browser.getUrl(\'https://duckduckgo.com\');\\n\\nwebpage.enterSearchValue(\'how to boil an egg\');\\nwebpage.click(searchButton);\\n\\n```\\n\\nAgain: We have the search **automated**t, **not** but the search result **checked**. So we don\'t know if our search actually worked."}]}')}}]);
